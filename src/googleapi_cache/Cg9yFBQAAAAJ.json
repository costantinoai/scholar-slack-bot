            "abstract": "We often need to decide whether the object we look at is also the object we look for. When we look for one specific object, this process can be facilitated by preparatory feature-based attention. However, when we look for multiple objects at the same time (e.g., the products on our shopping list) such a strategy may no longer be possible, as research has shown that we can actively prepare to detect only one object at a time. Therefore, looking for multiple objects may additionally involve search in long-term memory, slowing down decision making. Interestingly, however, previous research has shown that memory search can be very efficient when distractor objects are from a different category than the items in the memory set. Here, using EEG, we show that this efficiency is supported by top-down attention at the category level. In Experiment 1, human participants (both sexes) performed a memory search task on individually presented objects of the same or different category as the objects in the memory set. We observed category-level attentional modulation of distractor processing from ~150 ms after stimulus onset, expressed both as an evoked response modulation and as an increase in decoding accuracy of same-category distractors. In Experiment 2, memory search was performed on two concurrently presented objects. When both objects were distractors, spatial attention (indexed by the N2pc component) was directed to the object that was of the same category as the objects in the memory set. Together, these results demonstrate how attention can facilitate memory search."

            "abstract": "We use visual information to build up complex and meaningful mental models of ourselves and our environments. However, it is largely unknown how expectations derived from these complex mental models influence eye movements. To address this question we here recorded gaze behaviour of adult human volunteers as they were watching picture stories. These were presented either in a meaningful order, or a scrambled order. Each story was presented repeatedly, allowing to assess how narrative knowledge influences subsequent visual sampling. We tested how a state-of-the-art model of gaze behaviour based on visual saliency, DeepGaze II, accounts for the observed gaze behaviour. Our preliminary results indicate that the model captures gaze behaviour better when images are presented in a scrambled than intact order, and during first rather than subsequent viewing. This suggests that as one acquires expectations about the narrative, either from world knowledge or from previous experience, sampling behaviour starts to deviate from what can be predicted based on a visual saliency model. We speculate that this is caused by a shift towards information sampling based on meaning-based expectations. We are currently testing this hypothesis by quantifying meaning-based expectations in stories using language modelling (GPT-2)."

Despite this complexity, we recognize scenes, and objects within these scenes, from a brief glance at an image. In this review, we synthesize recent behavioral and neural findings that elucidate the mechanisms underlying this impressive ability. First, we review evidence that visual object and scene processing is partly implemented in parallel, allowing for a rapid initial gist of both objects and scenes concurrently. Next, we discuss recent evidence for bidirectional interactions between object and scene processing, with scene information modulating the visual processing of objects, and object information modulating the visual processing of scenes. Finally, we review evidence that objects also combine with each other to form object constellations, modulating the processing of individual objects within the object pathway. Altogether, these findings can be understood by conceptualizing object and scene perception as the outcome of a joint probabilistic inference, in which \u201cbest guesses\u201d about objects act as priors for scene perception and vice versa, in order to concurrently optimize visual inference of objects and scenes."

Although objects and scenes are processed in separate pathways in visual cortex, their processing interacts. Specifically, previous studies have shown that scene context makes blurry objects look sharper, an effect that can be observed as a sharpening of object representations in visual cortex from around 300 ms after stimulus onset. Here, we use MEG to show that objects can also sharpen scene representations, with the same temporal profile. Photographs of indoor (closed) and outdoor (open) scenes were blurred such that they were difficult to categorize on their own but easily disambiguated by the inclusion of an object. Classifiers were trained to distinguish MEG response patterns to intact indoor and outdoor scenes, presented in an independent run, and tested on degraded scenes in the main experiment. Results revealed better decoding of scenes with objects than scenes alone and objects alone from 300 ms after stimulus onset. This effect was strongest over left posterior sensors. These findings show that the influence of objects on scene representations occurs at similar latencies as the influence of scenes on object representations, in line with a common predictive processing mechanism."

In the real world, such inputs typically comprise a collection of objects (e.g. a forest constitutes numerous trees). The present study aimed to investigate whether perceptual anticipation relies on lower-level or higher-level information. Specifically, we examined whether the human brain anticipates each object in a scene individually or anticipates the scene as a whole. To explore this issue, we first trained participants to associate co-occurring objects within fixed spatial arrangements. Meanwhile, participants implicitly learned temporal regularities between these displays. We then tested how spatial and temporal violations of the structure modulated behavior and neural activity in the visual system using fMRI. We found that participants only showed a behavioral advantage of temporal regularities when the displays conformed to \u2026"

However, other work has provided evidence for a similar categorical organization in the absence of visual input, suggesting that it may also be shaped by top-down feedback processing. Here, to reveal such feedback processing, we focus on the selective response to large objects (buildings) in the scene-selective parahippocampal place area (PPA). Specifically, we tested whether the selective response to buildings in the PPA: 1) can be observed when controlling for visual features typical of buildings (eg, rectilinearity), 2) is delayed relative to the PPA response to scenes, and 3) reflects top-down activation of scene \u2026"

            "abstract": "According to theories of visual search, observers generate a visual representation of the search target (the \u2018attentional template\u2019) that guides spatial attention towards target-like visual input. In real-world vision, however, objects produce vastly different visual input depending on their location: your car produces a retinal image that is ten times smaller when it\u2019s parked fifty compared to five meters away. Across four experiments, we investigated whether the attentional template incorporates viewing distance when observers search for familiar object categories. On each trial, participants were pre-cued to search for a car or person in the near or far plane of an outdoor scene. In \u2018search trials\u2019, the scene reappeared and participants had to indicate whether the search target was present or absent. In intermixed \u2018catch-trials\u2019, two silhouettes were briefly presented on either side of fixation (matching the shape and/or predicted size of the search target), one of which was followed by a probe-stimulus. We found that participants were more accurate at reporting the location (Exp. 1&2) and orientation (Exp. 3) of probe-stimuli when they were presented at the location of size-matching silhouettes. Thus, attentional templates incorporate the predicted size of an object based on the current viewing distance. This was only the case, however, when silhouettes also matched the shape of the search target (Exp 2). We conclude that attentional templates for finding objects in scenes are shaped by a combination of category-specific attributes (shape) and context-dependent expectations about the likely appearance (size) of these objects at the current viewing location."

What drives this size Stroop effect? One possibility is that real-world size is automatically retrieved after the objects are recognized. Alternatively, the effect may be driven by automatic associations between mid-level visual features (eg, rectilinearity) and real-world size, bypassing object recognition. Here, we tested both accounts. In Experiment 1, objects were displayed upright and inverted, disrupting recognition while equating visual features. Inversion strongly reduced the Stroop effect. In Experiment 2, the Stroop effect was compared between manmade objects (for which rectilinearity was associated with size) and animals (no association between rectilinearity and size). The size Stroop effect was larger for animals than for manmade objects, indicating that rectilinearity was not primarily driving the Stroop effect. Finally, in Experiment 3, unrecognizable \u201ctexform\u201d objects that maintained size-related visual feature differences were displayed upright and inverted. Results revealed a relatively small Stroop effect for both upright and inverted conditions. Altogether, these results indicate that the automatic retrieval of real-world object size knowledge primarily follows object recognition with an additional contribution from visual feature associations."

            "abstract": "Capacity limitations in visual tasks can be observed when the number of task-related objects increases. An influential idea is that such capacity limitations are determined by competition at the neural level: two objects that are encoded by shared neural populations interfere more in behavior (e.g., visual search) than two objects encoded by separate neural populations. However, the neural representational similarity of objects varies across brain regions and across time, raising the question of where and when competition determines task performance. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between neural representational similarity and task performance is common or unique across tasks. Here, we used neural representational similarity derived from fMRI, MEG, and deep neural networks (DNN) to predict performance on two visual search tasks involving the same objects and requiring the same responses but differing in instructions: cued visual search and oddball visual search. Separate groups of participants viewed the individual objects in neuroimaging experiments to establish the neural representational similarity between those objects. Results showed that performance on both search tasks could be predicted by neural representational similarity throughout the visual system (fMRI), from 80 msec after onset (MEG), and in all DNN layers. Stepwise regression analysis, however, revealed task-specific associations, with unique variability in oddball visual search performance predicted by early/posterior neural similarity, and unique variability in cued visual search task performance predicted by late/anterior neural similarity.
