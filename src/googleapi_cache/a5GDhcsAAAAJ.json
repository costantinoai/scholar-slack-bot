            "abstract": "Using univariate analysis, a previous study by Wang et al. (2020) found a scaffolding effect of earlier phonological representation in superior temporal gyrus (STG) on later reading skill but failed to observe a sculpting effect of earlier reading on later phonological representation. The current study applied multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine if both scaffolding and sculpting effects were present in young children. We found that better initial reading skill predicted higher decoding coefficient of brain activity patterns for phonological representations in STG. This sculpting effect was present only for decoding small grain sizes (phonemes) and in younger children (6- to 7.5-year-olds), as we did not find any effects for large grain sizes (rhymes) or older children (7.5- to 9.5-year-olds). Although a scaffolding effect was not observed, the current study provides the first neural evidence of how earlier reading sculpts \u2026"

A recent study revealed a series of 3\u20134 topographical maps arranged along the macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex. The maps articulated a two-dimensional space based on the spikiness and animacy of visual objects, with \u201cinanimate-spiky\u201d and \u201cinanimate-stubby\u201d regions of the maps constituting two previously unidentified cortical networks. The goal of our study was to determine whether a similar functional organization might exist in human IT. To address this question, we presented the same object stimuli and images from \u201cclassic\u201d object categories (bodies, faces, houses) to humans while recording fMRI activity at 7 Tesla. Contrasts designed to reveal the spikiness-animacy object space evoked extensive significant activation across human IT. However, unlike the macaque, we did \u2026"

However, there are open questions regarding adaptation to stimuli that are changing over time, interrupted, or repeated. Feature-specific adaptation to repeating stimuli has been shown to occur as early as primary visual cortex (V1), but there is also evidence for more generalized, fatigue-like adaptation that might occur at an earlier stage of processing. Here, we show adaptation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake, fixating monkeys following brief (1 s) exposure to repeated cycles of a 4-Hz drifting grating. We examined the relative change of each neuron\u2019s response across successive (repeated) grating cycles. We found that neurons from all cell classes (parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular) showed significant adaptation \u2026"
