Here, we test 2 hypotheses: (1) white matter tracts are specific for each category or (2) white matter tracts are specific to cytoarchitectonic areas of VTC. To test these hypotheses, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to identify white matter tracts and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify category-selective regions in VTC in children and adults.

However, the principles underlying the emergence and utility of functional organization are poorly understood. Here we develop the Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network (TDANN), the first unified model to accurately predict the functional organization of multiple cortical areas in the primate visual system. We analyze the key factors responsible for the TDANN's success and find that it strikes a balance between two specific objectives: achieving a task-general sensory representation that is self-supervised, and maximizing the smoothness of responses across the cortical sheet according to a metric that scales relative to cortical surface area. In turn, the representations learned by the TDANN are lower dimensional and more brain-like than those in models that lack a spatial smoothness constraint. Finally, we provide evidence that the TDANN's functional organization balances performance with inter-area connection length, and use the resulting models for a proof-of-principle optimization of cortical prosthetic design. Our results thus offer a unified principle for understanding functional organization and a novel view of the functional role of the visual system in particular."

However, we know relatively little about the spatiotemporal characteristics of pRFs because the temporal properties of neurons are one to two orders of magnitude faster than fMRI BOLD responses. Here, we developed an image-computable framework to estimate spatiotemporal pRFs from fMRI data. First, we developed a simulation software that predicts fMRI responses to a time varying visual input given a spatiotemporal pRF model and solves the model parameters. The simulator revealed that ground-truth spatiotemporal parameters can be accurately recovered at the millisecond resolution from synthesized fMRI responses. Then, using fMRI and a novel stimulus paradigm, we mapped spatiotemporal pRFs in individual voxels across human visual cortex in 10 participants. We find that a compressive spatiotemporal (CST) pRF model better explains fMRI responses than a conventional spatial pRF model across visual areas spanning the dorsal, lateral, and ventral streams. Further, we find three organizational principles of spatiotemporal pRFs: (i) from early to later areas within a visual stream, spatial and temporal integration windows of pRFs progressively increase in size and show greater compressive nonlinearities, (ii) later visual areas show diverging spatial and temporal integration windows across streams, and (iii) within early visual areas (V1-V3), both spatial and temporal integration windows systematically increase with eccentricity.

We discovered a staggered development of category representations. Representations of faces emerge first, between 4-6 months and strengthen thereafter. Whereby representations for limbs, corridors, and characters emerge later, between 6-15 months. Not only do these data suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of everyday categories take different durations to develop. Thus, these findings necessitate a rethinking of the development of category representations in infancy and, have important implications for assessing atypical cortical development."

The prevailing hypothesis suggests that this suppression is due to competition among multiple stimuli for limited resources within receptive fields, governed by task demands. However, it is unknown how stimulus-driven computations may give rise to simultaneous suppression. Using fMRI, we find simultaneous suppression in single voxels, which varies with both stimulus size and timing, and progressively increases up the visual hierarchy. Using population receptive field (pRF) models, we find that compressive spatiotemporal summation rather than compressive spatial summation predicts simultaneous suppression, and that increased simultaneous suppression is linked to larger pRF sizes and stronger compressive nonlinearities. These results necessitate a rethinking of simultaneous suppression as the outcome of stimulus-driven compressive spatiotemporal computations within pRFs, and open new opportunities to study visual processing capacity across space and time."

These results suggest that being born slows the rate of myelin growths. This reduction in the rate of myelin growth at birth, in turn, explains lower myelin content in individuals born preterm, and could account for long-term cognitive, neurological, and developmental consequences of preterm birth.
