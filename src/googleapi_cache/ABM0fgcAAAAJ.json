DWI can be used to identify and characterize individual-specific white matter bundles, enabling precise analyses on hypothesis-driven connections in the brain and bridging the relationships between brain structure, function, and behavior. However, cortical endpoints of bundles may span larger areas than what a researcher is interested in, challenging presumptions that bundles are specifically tied to certain brain functions. Functional MRI (fMRI) can be integrated to further refine bundles such that they are restricted to functionally-defined cortical regions. Analyzing properties of these Functional Sub-Bundles (FSuB) increases precision and interpretability of results when studying neural connections supporting specific tasks. Several parameters of DWI and fMRI analyses, ranging from data acquisition to processing, can impact the efficacy of integrating functional and diffusion MRI. Here, we discuss the applications of the FSuB approach, suggest best practices for acquiring and processing neuroimaging data towards this end, and introduce the FSuB-Extractor, a flexible open-source software for creating FSuBs. We demonstrate our processing code and the FSuB-Extractor on an openly-available dataset, the Natural Scenes Dataset."

A long-standing hypothesis is that the functional organization into streams emerged to support distinct visual behaviors. Here, we use a neural network-based computational model and a massive fMRI dataset to test how visual streams emerge. We find that models trained for stream-specific visual behaviors poorly capture neural responses and organization. Instead, a self-supervised Topographic Deep Artificial Neural Network, which encourages nearby units to respond similarly, successfully predicts neural responses, spatial segregation, and functional differentiation across streams. These findings challenge the prevailing view that streams evolved to separately support different behaviors, and suggest instead that functional organization arises from a single principle: balancing general representation learning with local spatial constraints."

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to longitudinally measure the development of distributed responses across ventral temporal cortex to 10 categories in school-age children over several years. Our results reveal both strengthening and weakening of category representations with age, which was mainly driven by changes across category-selective voxels.

To test these hypotheses, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to identify white matter tracts and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify category-selective regions in VTC in children and adults.

We analyze the key factors responsible for the TDANN's success and find that it strikes a balance between two specific objectives: achieving a task-general sensory representation that is self-supervised, and maximizing the smoothness of responses across the cortical sheet according to a metric that scales relative to cortical surface area. In turn, the representations learned by the TDANN are lower dimensional and more brain-like than those in models that lack a spatial smoothness constraint. Finally, we provide evidence that the TDANN's functional organization balances performance with inter-area connection length, and use the resulting models for a proof-of-principle optimization of cortical prosthetic design. Our results thus offer a unified principle for understanding functional organization and a novel view of the functional role of the visual system in particular."

We discovered a staggered development of category representations. Representations of faces emerge first, between 4-6 months and strengthen thereafter. Whereby representations for limbs, corridors, and characters emerge later, between 6-15 months. Not only do these data suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of everyday categories take different durations to develop. Thus, these findings necessitate a rethinking of the development of category representations in infancy and, have important implications for assessing atypical cortical development."

            "abstract": "The formation of myelin, the fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers, is critical for healthy brain function. A fundamental open question is what is the impact of being born on myelin growth. To address this question, we evaluated a large (n=300) cross-sectional sample of newborns from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). First, we developed new software for the automated identification of 20 white matter bundles in individuals that is well-suited for large samples. Next, we fit linear models that quantify T1w/T2w, a myelin-sensitive imaging contrast, increases along bundles. We found faster growth of T1w/T2w along the lengths of all bundles before birth than right after birth. Further, in a separate longitudinal sample of preterm infants (N=34), we found lower T1w/T2w at term-equivalent age than in full-term peers. By applying the linear models fit on the cross-section sample to the longitudinal sample of preterm infants, we find that their delay in T1w/T2w growth is well explained by the amount of time preterm infants spend developing in utero and ex utero. These results suggest that being born slows the rate of myelin growths. This reduction in the rate of myelin growth at birth, in turn, explains lower myelin content in individuals born preterm, and could account for long-term cognitive, neurological, and developmental consequences of preterm birth. We hypothesize that closely matching the environment of infants born preterm to what they would have experienced in the womb may reduce delays in myelin growth and hence improve developmental outcomes."

Word-selective regions are left lateralized and emerge at the onset of reading instruction. Face-selective regions are right lateralized and have been documented in infancy. Prevailing theories suggest that face-selective regions become right lateralized due to competition with word-selective regions in the left hemisphere. However, recent longitudinal studies examining face- and word-selective responses in childhood do not provide support for this theory. Instead, there is evidence that word representations recycle cortex previously involved in processing other stimuli, such as limbs. These findings call for more longitudinal investigations of cortical recycling and a new era of work that links visual experience and behavior with neural responses."

To answer this question, we used fMRI and computational modeling to test the extent to which linear spatial summation, compressive spatial summation (CSS), or compressive spatiotemporal summation (CST) within population receptive fields (pRFs) of visual areas predicts simultaneous suppression. Ten subjects participated in two sessions:(i) retinotopy to independently estimate spatial pRF parameters and (ii) simultaneous/sequential experiment in which colorful squares were presented either simultaneously or sequentially in the periphery.

The prevailing hypothesis suggests that this suppression is due to competition among multiple stimuli for limited resources within receptive fields, governed by task demands. However, it is unknown how stimulus-driven computations may give rise to simultaneous suppression. Using fMRI, we find simultaneous suppression in single voxels, which varies with both stimulus size and timing, and progressively increases up the visual hierarchy. Using population receptive field (pRF) models, we find that compressive spatiotemporal summation rather than compressive spatial summation predicts simultaneous suppression, and that increased simultaneous suppression is linked to larger pRF sizes and stronger compressive nonlinearities. These results necessitate a rethinking of simultaneous suppression as the outcome of stimulus-driven compressive spatiotemporal computations within pRFs, and open new opportunities to study visual processing capacity across space and time."
