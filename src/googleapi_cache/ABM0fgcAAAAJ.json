            "abstract": "High-level visual areas in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) support recognition of important categories, such as faces and words. Word-selective regions are left lateralized and emerge at the onset of reading instruction. Face-selective regions are right lateralized and have been documented in infancy. Prevailing theories suggest that face-selective regions become right lateralized due to competition with word-selective regions in the left hemisphere. However, recent longitudinal studies examining face- and word-selective responses in childhood do not provide support for this theory. Instead, there is evidence that word representations recycle cortex previously involved in processing other stimuli, such as limbs. These findings call for more longitudinal investigations of cortical recycling and a new era of work that links visual experience and behavior with neural responses."

However, we know relatively little about the spatiotemporal characteristics of pRFs because neurons' temporal properties are one to two orders of magnitude faster than fMRI BOLD responses. Here, we developed an image-computable framework to estimate spatiotemporal pRFs from fMRI data. First, we developed a simulation software that predicts fMRI responses to a time-varying visual input given a spatiotemporal pRF model and solves the model parameters. The simulator revealed that ground-truth spatiotemporal parameters can be accurately recovered at the millisecond resolution from synthesized fMRI responses. Then, using fMRI and a novel stimulus paradigm, we mapped spatiotemporal pRFs in individual voxels across human visual cortex in 10 \u2026"

However, the principles underlying the emergence of functional organization in the cortex are poorly understood. Here, we develop the topographic deep artificial neural network (TDANN), the first model to predict several aspects of the functional organization of multiple cortical areas in the primate visual system. We analyze the factors driving the TDANN's success and find that it balances two objectives: learning a task-general sensory representation and maximizing the spatial smoothness of responses according to a metric that scales with cortical surface area. In turn, the representations learned by the TDANN are more brain-like than in spatially unconstrained models. Finally, we provide evidence that the TDANN's functional organization balances performance with between \u2026"

DWI can be used to identify and characterize individual-specific white matter bundles, enabling precise analyses on hypothesis-driven connections in the brain and bridging the relationships between brain structure, function, and behavior. However, cortical endpoints of bundles may span larger areas than what a researcher is interested in, challenging presumptions that bundles are specifically tied to certain brain functions. Functional MRI (fMRI) can be integrated to further refine bundles such that they are restricted to functionally-defined cortical regions. Analyzing properties of these Functional Sub-Bundles (FSuB) increases precision and interpretability of results when studying neural connections supporting specific tasks. Several parameters of DWI and fMRI analyses, ranging from data acquisition to processing, can impact the efficacy of integrating functional and diffusion MRI. Here, we discuss the applications of the FSuB approach, suggest best practices for acquiring and processing neuroimaging data towards this end, and introduce the FSuB-Extractor, a flexible open-source software for creating FSuBs. We demonstrate our processing code and the FSuB-Extractor on an openly-available dataset, the Natural Scenes Dataset."
