            "abstract": "Lesions in language-dominant ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC) can result in selective impairment of either reading and naming, resulting in alexia or anomia. Yet, functional imaging studies that show differential activation for naming and reading do not reveal activity exclusively tuned to one of these inputs.To resolve this dissonance in the functional architecture of vOTC, we used focused stimulation to the vOTC in 49 adult patients during reading and naming, and generated a population-level, probabilistic map to evaluate if reading and naming are clearly dissociable within individuals. Language mapping (50\u2005Hz, 2,829 stimulations) was performed during passage reading (216 positive sites) and visual naming (304 positive sites).Within vOTC we isolated sites that selectively disrupted reading (24 sites, 11 patients) or naming (27 sites in 12 patients), and those that disrupted both processes (75 \u2026"
