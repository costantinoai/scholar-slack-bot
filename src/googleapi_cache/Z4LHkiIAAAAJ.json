Yet, we still lack sensitive tools for stratifying patients early, resulting in patients being undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed. Despite rapid expansion in machine learning models for dementia prediction, limited model interpretability and generalizability impede translation to the clinic. Methods We build a robust and interpretable predictive prognostic model (PPM) and validate its clinical utility using real-world, routinely-collected, non-invasive, and low-cost (cognitive tests, structural MRI) patient data. To enhance scalability and generalizability to the clinic, we: 1) train the PPM with clinically-relevant predictors (cognitive tests, grey matter atrophy) that are common across research and clinical cohorts, 2) test PPM predictions with independent multicenter real-world data from memory clinics across countries (UK, Singapore). Findings PPM robustly predicts (accuracy: 81.7%, AUC: 0.84, sensitivity: 82.4. 9%, specificity: 80.94%) whether patients at early disease stages (MCI) will remain stable or progress to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). PPM generalizes from research to real-world patient data across memory clinics and its predictions are validated against longitudinal clinical outcomes. PPM allows us to derive an individualized AI-guided multimodal marker (ie predictive prognostic index) that predicts progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical markers (grey matter atrophy, cognitive scores; PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio= 3.42, p= 0.01) or clinical diagnosis (PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio= 2.84, p< 0.005), reducing misdiagnosis \u2026"

Yet, we still lack a mechanistic account of how the brain forms these mental templates of task-relevant features to optimize decision making. Here, we provide evidence for recurrent inhibition: an experience-dependent plasticity mechanism that refines mental templates by enhancing GABAergic inhibition and recurrent processing in superficial visual cortex layers. We combine ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI at submillimetre resolution with magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the fine-scale functional and neurochemical plasticity mechanisms for optimized perceptual decisions. We demonstrate that GABAergic inhibition increases following training on a visual (ie, fine orientation) discrimination task, enhancing the discriminability of orientation representations in superficial visual cortex layers that are known to support recurrent processing. Modelling functional and neurochemical plasticity interactions reveals that recurrent inhibitory processing optimizes brain computations for perpetual decisions and adaptive behavior"

We first introduce a bilevel hypergraph optimisation framework that jointly learns a graph augmentation policy and a semi-supervised classifier. This dual learning strategy is hypothesised to enhance the robustness and generalisation capabilities of the model by fostering new pathways for information propagation. Secondly, we introduce a novel strategy for generating pseudo-labels more effectively via a gradient-driven flow. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over current techniques in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease."

Changes in the workplace over the past decades have spawned an increase in research investigating contemporary career types, which are characterized by increased self-directedness, flexibility, and the aim of subjective career success. Living in a dynamic and complex environment necessitates that all living organisms be flexible and adaptive to survive (Powell & Ragozzino, 2017). Humans are required to proactively equip themselves with the ability to shift their strategies and update their beliefs and actions in response to changing environmental demands (Diamond, 2006; Garcia-Garcia et al., 2010; Geurts et al., 2009; Herrmann et al., 2015). For instance, the increasing volatility in the 21st-century workforce, particularly during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, has served as a timely reminder of the urgency of cultivating the flexibility to respond to unforeseen changes and uncertainties more adaptively in order to stay competitive in turbulent job markets. The view of a linear career path (whereby workers are only trained to perform and master one job) that dominated the mainstream workplace system \u2026"
