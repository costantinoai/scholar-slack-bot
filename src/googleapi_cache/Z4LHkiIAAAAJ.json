This key ability known as cognitive flexibility involves learning the structure of the environment, switching attention between features, dimensions and tasks, and adopting new rules in the face of uncertainty. Training cognitive flexibility has strong potential to improve adaptive behavior across the lifespan with impact in real-world settings (eg educational, clinical). Here, we review evidence on the role of cognitive training in improving executive functions and the factors that may enhance the effectiveness of training programs. We propose that personalized and adaptive training programs that focus on the multifaceted abilities comprising cognitive flexibility are key for promoting adaptive behavior and lifelong learning in real-world settings."

            "abstract": "We investigated the utility of Wishart processes (WP) for estimating time-varying functional connectivity (TVFC), which captures changes in functional coupling as the correlation between brain region activity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The WP is a stochastic process on covariance matrices that can be used to model dynamic covariances between time series, which makes it a natural fit to this task. Recent advances in scalable approximate inference techniques and the availability of robust open-source libraries have rendered the WP practically viable for fMRI applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess WP performance compared to a selection of established TVFC estimation methods. The framework contains simulations with specified ground-truth covariance structures, a subject phenotype prediction task, a test-retest study, a brain state analysis, an external stimulus prediction task, and a novel data-driven imputation benchmark. The WP performed competitively across all the benchmarks. It outperformed a sliding window (SW) approach with adaptive cross-validated window lengths and a DCC-MGARCH baseline on the external stimulus prediction task, while being less prone to false positives in the TVFC null models."

MTM training on trajectories stratifies individuals into clinically meaningful clusters more reliably than model training on baseline data alone and is robust to missing data (ie, cognitive data alone or single assessments). Extracting an individualized cognitive health index (ie, MTM-derived cluster membership index) allows us to predict progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical assessments (ie, cognitive tests or MRI scans alone). Importantly, MTM generalizes successfully from research cohort to real-world clinical data from memory clinic patients with missing data, enhancing the clinical utility of our approach. Thus, our multimodal trajectory modeling approach provides a cost-effective and non-invasive tool for early dementia prediction without labeled data (ie clinical diagnosis) with strong potential for translation to clinical practice."

This challenge is tackled through a semi-supervised multi-modal diagnosis framework. In particular, we introduce a new hypergraph framework that enables higher-order relations between multi-modal data, while utilising minimal labels. We first introduce a bilevel hypergraph optimisation framework that jointly learns a graph augmentation policy and a semi-supervised classifier. This dual learning strategy is hypothesised to enhance the robustness and generalisation capabilities of the model by fostering new pathways for information propagation. Secondly, we introduce a novel strategy for generating pseudo-labels more effectively via a gradient-driven flow. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over current techniques in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease."

The current pre-registration form primarily aims to examining specific hypotheses related to the association between socio-cognitive variables and career development/transitional behaviours and outcomes, which might not be described in the main studies (https://osf. io/ay9gr; https://osf. io/n352u; https://osf. io/6rc9h) in detail. Changes in the workplace over the past decades have spawned an increase in research investigating contemporary career types, which are characterized by increased self-directedness, flexibility, and the aim of subjective career success. Living in a dynamic and complex environment necessitates that all living organisms be flexible and adaptive to survive (Powell & Ragozzino, 2017). Humans are required to proactively equip themselves with the ability to shift their strategies and update their beliefs and actions in response to changing environmental demands (Diamond, 2006; Garcia-Garcia et al., 2010; Geurts et al., 2009; Herrmann et al., 2015). For instance, the increasing volatility in the 21st-century workforce, particularly during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, has served as a timely reminder of the urgency of cultivating the flexibility to respond to unforeseen changes and uncertainties more adaptively in order to stay competitive in turbulent job markets. The view of a linear career path (whereby workers are only trained to perform and master one job) that dominated the mainstream workplace system \u2026"

However, how CF relates to other executive functions (e.g., working memory, response inhibition), mental abilities (e.g., creativity, literacy, numeracy, intelligence, structure learning), and social factors (e.g., multilingualism, tolerance of uncertainty, perceived social support, social decision-making) is less well understood. The current study aims to (1) establish the construct validity of CF in relation to other executive function skills and intelligence, and (2) elucidate specific relationships between CF, structure learning, creativity, career decision making and planning, and other life skills.This study will recruit up to 400 healthy Singaporean young adults (age 18\u201330) to complete a wide range of cognitive tasks and social questionnaires/tasks. The richness of the task/questionnaire battery and within-participant administration enables us to use computational modelling and structural equation modelling to examine connections between the latent constructs of interest.The current study is the first systematic investigation into the construct validity of CF and its interrelationship with other important cognitive skills such as learning and creativity, within an Asian context. The study will further explore the concept of CF as a non-unitary construct, a novel theoretical proposition in the field.

We use a visual flicker paradigm to entrain individuals at their own brain rhythm (i.e. peak alpha frequency) as measured by resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrate that this individual frequency-matched brain entrainment results in faster learning in a visual identification task (i.e. detecting targets embedded in background clutter) compared to entrainment that does not match an individual\u2019s alpha frequency.

Here, we ask whether uncertainty in dynamic environments affects our ability to learn predictive structures. We exposed participants to sequences of symbols determined by first-order Markov models and asked them to indicate which symbol they expected to follow each sequence. We introduced uncertainty in this prediction task by manipulating the: a) probability of symbol co-occurrence, b) stimulus presentation rate. Further, we manipulated feedback, as it is known to play a key role in resolving uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that increasing the similarity in the probabilities of symbol co-occurrence impaired performance on the prediction task. In contrast, increasing uncertainty in stimulus presentation rate by introducing temporal jitter resulted in participants adopting a strategy closer to probability maximization than matching and improving in the prediction tasks. Next, we show that feedback plays a key role in learning predictive statistics. Trial-by-trial feedback yielded stronger improvement than block feedback or no feedback; that is, participants adopted a strategy closer to probability maximization and showed stronger improvement when trained with trial-by-trial feedback. Further, correlating individual strategy with learning performance showed better performance in structure learning for observers who adopted a strategy closer to maximization.

            "abstract": "Although many cognitive measures have been developed to assess cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is little consensus on optimal measures, leading to varied assessments across research cohorts and clinical trials making it difficult to pool cognitive measures across studies.We used a two\u2010stage approach to harmonize cognitive data across cohorts and derive a cross\u2010cohort score of cognitive impairment due to AD. First, we pool and harmonize cognitive data from international cohorts of varying size and ethnic diversity. Next, we derived cognitive composites that leverage maximal data from the harmonized dataset.We show that our cognitive composites are robust across cohorts and achieve greater or comparable sensitivity to AD\u2010related cognitive decline compared to the Mini\u2010Mental State Examination and Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive \u2026"

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease prognosis is critical for early Mild Cognitive Impairment patients for timely treatment to improve the patient's quality of life. Whilst existing prognosis techniques demonstrate potential results, they are highly limited in terms of using a single modality. Most importantly, they fail in considering a key element for prognosis: not all features extracted at the current moment may contribute to the prognosis prediction several years later. To address the current drawbacks of the literature, we propose a novel hypergraph framework based on an information bottleneck strategy (HGIB). Firstly, our framework seeks to discriminate irrelevant information, and therefore, solely focus on harmonising relevant information for future MCI conversion prediction e.g., two years later). Secondly, our model simultaneously accounts for multi-modal data based on imaging and non-imaging modalities. HGIB uses a hypergraph structure to represent the multi-modality data and accounts for various data modality types. Thirdly, the key of our model is based on a new optimisation scheme. It is based on modelling the principle of information bottleneck into loss functions that can be integrated into our hypergraph neural network. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments on ADNI, that our proposed HGIB framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks for Alzheimer's disease prognosis. We showcase our model even under fewer labels. Finally, we further support the robustness and generalisation capabilities of our framework under both topological and feature perturbations."

We demonstrate that training alters subcortical (pulvinar, hippocampus) myelination and its functional connectivity to visual cortex and relates to decreased visual cortex GABAergic inhibition. Modeling interactions between MRI measures of myelin, GABA, and functional connectivity indicates that pulvinar myelin plasticity interacts\u2014through thalamocortical connectivity\u2014with GABAergic inhibition in visual cortex to support learning.

Here, we ask whether uncertainty in dynamic environments affects our ability to learn predictive structures. We exposed participants to sequences of symbols determined by first-order Markov models and asked them to indicate which symbol they expected to follow each sequence. We introduced uncertainty in this prediction task by manipulating the:(a) probability of symbol co-occurrence,(b) stimulus presentation rate. Further, we manipulated feedback, as it is known to play a key role in resolving uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that increasing the similarity in the probabilities of symbol co-occurrence impaired performance on the prediction task. In contrast, increasing uncertainty in stimulus presentation rate by introducing temporal jitter \u2026"
