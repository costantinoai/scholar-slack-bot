However, how CF relates to other executive functions (e.g., working memory, response inhibition), mental abilities (e.g., creativity, literacy, numeracy, intelligence, structure learning), and social factors (e.g., multilingualism, tolerance of uncertainty, perceived social support, social decision-making) is less well understood. The current study aims to (1) establish the construct validity of CF in relation to other executive function skills and intelligence, and (2) elucidate specific relationships between CF, structure learning, creativity, career decision making and planning, and other life skills.This study will recruit up to 400 healthy Singaporean young adults (age 18\u201330) to complete a wide range of cognitive tasks and social questionnaires/tasks. The richness of the task/questionnaire battery and within-participant administration enables us to use computational modelling and structural equation modelling to examine connections between the latent constructs of interest.The current study is the first systematic investigation into the construct validity of CF and its interrelationship with other important cognitive skills such as learning and creativity, within an Asian context. The study will further explore the concept of CF as a non-unitary construct, a novel theoretical proposition in the field.

Participants are pseudo-randomised to either the Training or Control group, while matched on age, sex, intelligence and cognitive flexibility performance. In the Training group, participants undergo around 2 weeks of training (at least 13 sessions) on Structure Learning.

Here, we ask whether uncertainty in dynamic environments affects our ability to learn predictive structures. We exposed participants to sequences of symbols determined by first-order Markov models and asked them to indicate which symbol they expected to follow each sequence. We introduced uncertainty in this prediction task by manipulating the: a) probability of symbol co-occurrence, b) stimulus presentation rate. Further, we manipulated feedback, as it is known to play a key role in resolving uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that increasing the similarity in the probabilities of symbol co-occurrence impaired performance on the prediction task. In contrast, increasing uncertainty in stimulus presentation rate by introducing temporal jitter resulted in participants adopting a strategy closer to probability maximization than matching and improving in the prediction tasks. Next, we show that feedback plays a key role in learning predictive statistics. Trial-by-trial feedback yielded stronger improvement than block feedback or no feedback; that is, participants adopted a strategy closer to probability maximization and showed stronger improvement when trained with trial-by-trial feedback. Further, correlating individual strategy with learning performance showed better performance in structure learning for observers who adopted a strategy closer to maximization.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease prognosis is critical for early Mild Cognitive Impairment patients for timely treatment to improve the patient's quality of life. Whilst existing prognosis techniques demonstrate potential results, they are highly limited in terms of using a single modality. Most importantly, they fail in considering a key element for prognosis: not all features extracted at the current moment may contribute to the prognosis prediction several years later. To address the current drawbacks of the literature, we propose a novel hypergraph framework based on an information bottleneck strategy (HGIB). Firstly, our framework seeks to discriminate irrelevant information, and therefore, solely focus on harmonising relevant information for future MCI conversion prediction e.g., two years later). Secondly, our model simultaneously accounts for multi-modal data based on imaging and non-imaging modalities. HGIB uses a hypergraph structure to represent the multi-modality data and accounts for various data modality types. Thirdly, the key of our model is based on a new optimisation scheme. It is based on modelling the principle of information bottleneck into loss functions that can be integrated into our hypergraph neural network. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments on ADNI, that our proposed HGIB framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks for Alzheimer's disease prognosis. We showcase our model even under fewer labels. Finally, we further support the robustness and generalisation capabilities of our framework under both topological and feature perturbations."

Past attempts largely relied on traditional statistical approaches. Here, we investigated whether machine learning (ML) methods improved prediction of incident dementia in SVD from baseline SVD-related features over traditional statistical methods.We included three cohorts with varying SVD severity (RUN DMC, n = 503; SCANS, n = 121; HARMONISATION, n = 265). Baseline demographics, vascular risk factors, cognitive scores, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of SVD were used for prediction. We conducted both survival analysis and classification analysis predicting 3-year dementia risk. For each analysis, several ML methods were evaluated against standard Cox or logistic regression. Finally, we compared the feature \u2026"

Here, we ask whether uncertainty in dynamic environments affects our ability to learn predictive structures. We exposed participants to sequences of symbols determined by first-order Markov models and asked them to indicate which symbol they expected to follow each sequence. We introduced uncertainty in this prediction task by manipulating the:(a) probability of symbol co-occurrence,(b) stimulus presentation rate. Further, we manipulated feedback, as it is known to play a key role in resolving uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that increasing the similarity in the probabilities of symbol co-occurrence impaired performance on the prediction task. In contrast, increasing uncertainty in stimulus presentation rate by introducing temporal jitter \u2026"
