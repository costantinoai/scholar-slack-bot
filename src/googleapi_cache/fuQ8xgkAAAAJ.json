            "abstract": "High-level visual brain regions contain subareas in which neurons appear to respond more strongly to examples of a particular semantic category, like faces or bodies, rather than objects. However, recent work has shown that while this finding holds on average, some out-of-category stimuli also activate neurons in these regions. This may be due to visual features common among the preferred class also being present in other images. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for visualizing these features. For each neuron, we identify relevant visual features driving its selectivity by modelling responses to images based on latent activations of a deep neural network. Given an out-of-category image which strongly activates the neuron, our method first identifies a reference image from the preferred category yielding a similar feature activation pattern. We then backpropagate latent activations of both images to the pixel level, while enhancing the identified shared dimensions and attenuating non-shared features. The procedure highlights image regions containing shared features driving responses of the model neuron. We apply the algorithm to novel recordings from body-selective regions in macaque IT cortex in order to understand why some images of objects excite these neurons. Visualizations reveal object parts which resemble parts of a macaque body, shedding light on neural preference of these objects."

For the study of social vision in monkeys, highly controllable macaque face avatars have recently been developed, while body avatars with realistic motion do not yet exist. Addressing this gap, we developed a pipeline for three-dimensional motion tracking based on synchronized multi-view video recordings, achieving sufficient accuracy for life-like full-body animation. By exploiting data-driven pose estimation models, we track the complete time course of individual actions using a minimal set of hand-labeled keyframes. Our approach tracks single actions more accurately than existing pose estimation pipelines for behavioral tracking of non-human primates, requiring less data and fewer cameras. This efficiency is also confirmed for a state-of-the-art human benchmark dataset. An uncanny valley experiment with macaque monkeys demonstrates that animals perceive the generated animations as similar to genuine videos, and establishes an uncanny valley effect for bodies in monkeys."

However, there is currently scant evidence for expectation suppression in the visual system when confounding factors are taken into account.

Participants viewed naturalistic videos of monkey and human faces, bodies, and objects along with mosaic-scrambled videos for control of low-level features. Independent component analysis (ICA) based network analysis was conducted to find body and species modulations at both the voxel and the network levels. Among the body areas, the highest species selectivity was found in the middle frontal gyrus and amygdala. Two large-scale networks were highly selective to bodies, dominated by the lateral occipital cortex and right superior temporal sulcus (STS) respectively. The right STS network showed high species selectivity, and its significant human body-induced node connectivity was focused around the extrastriate body area (EBA), STS \u2026"

It is unknown, however, whether higher-order category-selective areas exhibit a similar mesoscale functional organization, nor whether mesoscale functional units are aggregated in functional networks spanning large distances (eg across hemispheres). Using sub-millimeter fMRI and single-cell recordings, we found that neurons with functionally similar tuning properties within face-and body-selective areas are spatially grouped into columnar-like mesoscale functional units, which also show segregated interhemispheric connectivity patterns. Hence, mesoscale functional networks may constitute fundamental architectural features of primate cortex."

Knowledge of perceptual learning requires basic and applied research in humans and nonhuman animal models, which informs strategic targets for advancing applications. Commercial products to induce perceptual learning are proliferating rapidly with limited regulation (e.g., for rehabilitation), while at the same time basic science is increasingly restricted by changing regulations (such as new granting-agency definitions of clinical trials). Realizing the full potential of perceptual learning requires balancing basic and translational science to advance new knowledge, while serving and protecting consumers.

We propose a physiologically-inspired neural model of the visual recognition of body movements, which combines an existing image-computable model (\u2018ShapeComp\u2019) that produces high-dimensional shape vectors of object silhouettes, with a neurodynamical model that encodes dynamic image sequences exploiting sequence-selective neural fields. The model successfully classifies videos of body silhouettes performing different actions.

In this fMRI-guided single-unit study, we investigated the contribution of shape and motion to the neural representations underlying the visual processing of moving bodies. We recorded single neurons, using the same videos and monkey subjects as for the fMRI mapping, in the dorsal (upper bank/fundus Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS)) and ventral (ventral bank/ventral to STS) dynamic body patches in the anterior temporal visual cortex. Most neurons responded more to body videos in both ventral and dorsal patches. Many neurons responded equally well \u2026"

These patches are located in the upper bank/fundus and lower bank of the Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and ventral to the STS. The anatomical organization of body-responsive regions can reflect functional differences, namely a difference in motion sensitivity along the dorso-ventral axis (VSS, Raman et al., 2023) and a difference in the complexity of feature coding along the visual hierarchy. To address the static feature selectivity of single neurons and recurrent interaction between these patches, we created a stimulus set of 720 stimuli, in which the same monkey avatar had 45 different body postures, rendered from a horizontal and top view from 8 different viewing angles.

Electrophysiological data from area IT helps to narrow down the possible underlying computations. METHODS We demonstrate that standard deep neural network models for visual processing fail at this task. We present a novel deep model that recognizes anorthoscopically presented body shapes, and also reproduces properties of IT neurons during anorthoscopic perception (Bognar & Vogels, 2021).
