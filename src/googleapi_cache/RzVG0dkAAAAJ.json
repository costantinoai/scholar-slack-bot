We then give an overview of the history and development of braille, focusing on its formal characteristics as a writing system, in order to acquaint sighted print readers with the basics of braille and to spark further interest among reading researchers. We then explore how print-centric assumptions and sight-centric motivations have potentially negative consequences, not only for braille users but also for the types of questions researchers think to pursue. We conclude with recommendations for conducting responsible and informed research about braille. We affirm that blindness is most equitably understood as but one of the many diverse ways humans experience the \u2026"

Neural correlates have been used to evaluate haptic perception and may provide a more objective approach to assess association performance than more commonly used behavioral measures of performance. In this paper, we examine Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of electroencephalography (EEG) as a framework to evaluate how the neural representation of multifeatured haptic cues changes with association training. We focus on the first phase of cross-modal associative learning, perception of multimodal cues. A participant learned to map phonemes to multimodal haptic cues, and EEG data were acquired before and after training to create neural representational spaces that \u2026"

In English and many other languages, reading and writing braille is not simply a matter of transliterating between print letters and their braille equivalents; Unified English Braille (the official braille system used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several other English-speaking countries) contains 180 contractions\u2014one or more braille cells that represent whole words or strings of letters.
