            "abstract": "Visual recognition is achieved in the brain by a series of hierarchical processing stages across areas of the ventral stream. Decoding object identity in this hierarchy is partially a bottom-up process, which accounts well for the recognition of easy, canonical appearances. Most natural settings, however, are visually complex, and present challenging viewing conditions. In the presence of visual uncertainty, the recognition of object identity is hence a hard decoding problem that cannot be solved by a purely bottom-up process. The human brain, however, is highly non-feedforward, and each area sends its connections downward or horizontally in the hierarchy. This non bottom-up, recurrent connectivity is thought to provide the necessary computational power to solve object recognition in the face of visual complexity. While evidence for this role is accumulating, the exact mechanisms of recurrent processing remain \u2026"

            "abstract": "Research in human vision has shown that visual recognition is achieved through the interaction of a number of specialized brain areas in the ventral and dorsal visual stream. The most influential models of visual perception theorize a feedforward, unidirectional flow of information from low-level to high-level areas. However, growing evidence suggests, on the one hand, that lateral connections and connections from high-to low-level areas (ie, top-down connections) may be crucially involved in more challenging object recognition tasks, and on the other hand that recurrent networks show higher correlation and have better predictivity of brain data. In this study, we explore the functional role of feedback connections in computational models of vision. To do so, we trained several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with and without recurrent connections (within layers, top-down, top-down+ within) to perform object \u2026"

            "abstract": "A classic view holds that visual object recognition is driven through the what pathway in which perceptual features of increasing abstractness are computed in a sequence of different visual cortical regions. The cortical origin of this pathway, the primary visual cortex (V1), has a retinotopic organization such that neurons have receptive fields tuned to specific regions of the visual field. That is, a neuron that responds to a stimulus in the center of the visual field will not respond to a stimulus in the periphery of the visual field, and vice versa. However, despite this fundamental design feature, the overall processing of stimuli in the periphery -- while clearly dependent on processing by neurons in the peripheral regions of V1 -- can be clearly altered by the processing of neurons in the fovea region of V1. For instance, it has been shown that task-relevant, non-retinotopic feedback information about peripherally presented stimuli can be decoded in the unstimulated foveal cortex, and that the disruption of this feedback -- through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or behavioral masking paradigms -- has detrimental effects on same/different discrimination behavior. Here, we used fMRI multivariate decoding techniques and functional connectivity analyses to assess the nature of the information that is encoded in the periphery-to-fovea feedback projection and to gain insight into how it may be anatomically implemented. Participants performed a same/different discrimination task on images of real-world stimuli (motorbikes, cars, female and male faces) displayed peripherally. We were able to decode only a subset of these categories from the activity measured in \u2026"
