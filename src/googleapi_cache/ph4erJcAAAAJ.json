Greater anisotropic diffusion indicates more coherent white matter. Anisotropy furthermore differentiated subtypes of grapheme-color synesthesia. Greater connectivity in the inferior temporal cortex was particularly strong for synesthetes who see synesthetic color in the outside world ('projectors') as compared with synesthetes who see the color in their 'mind's eye' only ('associators'). In contrast, greater connectivity (as compared with non-synesthetes) in the superior parietal or frontal cortex did not differentiate between subtypes of synesthesia. In conclusion, we found \u2026"

However, when human observers are cued to shift attention to one item in VSTM during retention, it seems as if there is a much larger representation, which keeps additional items in a more fragile VSTM store. Thus far, it is not clear whether the capacity of this fragile VSTM store indeed exceeds the traditional capacity limits of VSTM. The current experiments address this issue and explore the capacity, stability, and duration of fragile VSTM representations.We presented cues in a change-detection task either just after off-set of the memory array (iconic-cue), 1,000 ms after off-set of the memory array (retro-cue) or after on-set of the probe array (post-cue). We observed three stages in visual information processing 1) iconic memory with unlimited capacity, 2) a four seconds lasting fragile VSTM store with a capacity that is at least a factor of two higher than 3) the robust and capacity-limited form of VSTM. Iconic memory seemed to depend on the strength of the positive after-image resulting from the memory display and was virtually absent under conditions of isoluminance or when intervening light masks were presented. This suggests that iconic memory is driven by prolonged retinal activation beyond stimulus duration. Fragile VSTM representations were not affected by light masks, but were completely overwritten by irrelevant pattern masks that spatially overlapped the memory array.We find that immediately after a stimulus has disappeared from view \u2026"

However, studies from recent years indicate that visual perception\u2014and most notably visual awareness itself\u2014may depend strongly on cortico-cortical feedback connections from higher to lower visual areas. This has led some researchers to propose that masking derives its effectiveness from selectively interrupting these reentrant processes.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 20 human participants performing a Simon interference task with an occasional stop signal.

Behaviorally, unconscious No-Go signals sometimes triggered response inhibition to the level of complete response termination and yielded a slow down in the speed of responses that were not inhibited. Electroencephalographic recordings showed that unconscious No-Go signals elicit two neural events: (1) an early occipital event and (2) a frontocentral event somewhat later in time. The first \u2026"

Selective inhibition can be explored in detail by extracting parameters from response time (RT) distributions as derived from performance in the Simon task. Individual differences in RT distribution parameters not only can be used to probe the efficiency and temporal dynamics of selective response inhibition, but also allow a more detailed analysis of functional neuroimaging data. Such model-based analyses, which capitalize on individual differences, have demonstrated that selective response inhibition is subserved by the rIFC.

We investigated this by testing a large representative sample of the Dutch population on two attentional tasks: a visual search task gauging the efficiency of top-down attention and a singleton capture task gauging bottom-up attention. On both tasks we found typical performance\u2014ie, participants displayed a significant search slope on the search task and significant slowing caused by the unique, but irrelevant, object on the capture task. Moreover, the high levels of significance we observed indicate that the current set-up provided very high signal to noise ratios, and thus enough power to accurately unveil existing effects. Importantly, in this robust investigation we did not observe any correlation in performance between tasks. The use of Bayesian statistics strongly confirmed that performance on both tasks was uncorrelated. We argue that the current results suggest that there are two attentional systems that operate independently. We hypothesize that this may have implications beyond our understanding of attention. For instance, it may be that attention and consciousness are intertwined differently for top-down attention than for bottom-up attention."

By integrating results obtained so far in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies, this contribution sheds light on the role of particular brain regions in synaesthetic experiences. First, in accordance with its sensory nature, it seems that the sensory brain areas corresponding to the type of synaesthetic experience are activated. Synaesthetic colour experiences can activate colour regions in occipito\u2010temporal cortex, but this is not necessarily restricted to V4. Furthermore, sensory and motor brain regions have been obtained that extend beyond the particular type of synaesthesia studied.

We included forty-five patients with severe and treatment-resistant unipolar depression and collected functional magnetic resonance imaging scans before the course of ECT. We extracted resting-state networks and used multivariate pattern analysis to discover networks that predicted recovery from depression.

Because new visual objects readily overwrite this intermediate visual store, we believe that it reflects a weak form of VSTM with high capacity that exists alongside a strong but capacity-limited form of VSTM. In the present study, we isolated brain activity related to weak and strong VSTM representations using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that activity in visual cortical area V4 predicted the strength of VSTM representations; activity was low when there was no VSTM, medium when there was a weak VSTM representation regardless of whether this weak representation was available for report or not, and high when there was a strong VSTM representation \u2026"

In line with a neural network model explicating the role of feedforward, horizontal and recurrent processing in visual perception, we can attribute this deficit to a dysfunction of horizontal connections within early visual areas. Interestingly, ASD subjects showed an increase in subsequent activity at lateral occipital sites (225 ms), which might reflect a compensational mechanism. In contrast, recurrent processing between higher and lower visual areas (around 260 ms), associated with \u2026"

The distributions of contrast values in natural images generally follow a Weibull distribution, with beta and gamma as free parameters. Beta and gamma seem to structure the space of natural images in an ecologically meaningful way, in particular with respect to the fragmentation and texture similarity within an image. Since it is often assumed that the brain exploits structural regularities in natural image statistics to efficiently encode and analyze visual input, we here ask ourselves whether the brain approximates the beta and gamma values underlying the contrast distributions of natural images. We present a model that shows that beta and gamma can be easily estimated from the outputs of X-cells and Y-cells. In addition, we covaried the EEG responses of subjects viewing natural images with the beta and gamma values of those images. We show that beta and gamma explain up to 71% of the variance of the early ERP signal, substantially outperforming other tested contrast measurements. This suggests that the brain is strongly tuned to the image's beta and gamma values, potentially providing the visual system with an efficient way to rapidly classify incoming images on the basis of omnipresent low-level natural image statistics."

We presented people with a change detection task that measures the capacity of all three forms of VSTM, and we added an identification display after each change trial that required people to identify the \u201cpre-change\u201d object. Accurate change detection plus pre-change identification requires subjects to have a high-resolution representation of the \u201cpre-change\u201d object, whereas change detection or identification only can be based on the hunch that something has changed, without exactly knowing what was presented before. We observed that people maintained 6.1 objects in iconic memory, 4.6 objects in fragile VSTM, and 2.1 objects in visual working memory. Moreover, when people detected the change, they could also identify the pre-change object on 88% of the iconic memory trials, on 71% of the fragile VSTM trials and merely on 53% of the visual working memory trials. This suggests that people maintain many high-resolution representations in iconic memory and fragile VSTM, but only one high-resolution object representation in visual working memory."

We show that behavioral performance is directly related to these statistics, with naturalness rating being influenced in particular by SC. At the neural level, both statistics \u2026"

To date, it is unclear whether perceptual completion emerges during early stages of visual processing or whether higher-level mechanisms are necessary. To answer this question, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt signaling in V1/V2 and in the lateral occipital (LO) area at different moments in time while participants performed a discrimination task involving a Kanizsa-type illusory figure. Results show that both V1/V2 and higher-level visual area LO are critically involved in perceptual completion. However, these areas seem to be involved in an inverse hierarchical fashion, in which the critical time window for V1/V2 follows that for LO. These results are in line with the growing evidence that feedback to V1/V2 contributes to perceptual completion."

This practice, often combined with little more than an implicit theoretical stance, fails to address the relationship between neurological and behavioral measures explicitly. This article argues that the reduction problem, in essence, is a measurement problem. As such, it should be solved by using psychometric techniques and models. We show that two influential philosophical theories on this relationship, identity theory and supervenience theory, can be easily translated into psychometric models. Upon such translation, they make explicit hypotheses based on sound theoretical and statistical foundations, which renders them empirically testable. We examine these \u2026"

In this study, we use a comprehensive set of simulations as well as analyses of empirical data to evaluate two methods that were previously proposed and used to control for confounding variables in decoding analyses: post hoc counterbalancing and confound regression. In our empirical analyses, we attempt to decode gender from structural MRI data while controlling for the confound \u201cbrain size\u201d.

We presented non-segregating and occasionally segregating textures in two different conditions: 1. a condition where subjects were not informed about the presence of the segregating textures while at the same time engaged in a foveal task, resulting in prolonged inattentional blindness and 2. a condition with similar task demands, in which, however, the subjects perceived the segregating textures.

            "abstract": "Much controversy exists around the locus of conscious visual perception in human cortex. Some authors have proposed that its neural correlates correspond with recurrent processing within visual cortex, whereas others have argued they are located in a frontoparietal network. The present experiment aims to bring together these competing viewpoints. We recorded EEG from human subjects that were engaged in detecting masked visual targets. From this, we obtained a spatiotemporal profile of neural activity selectively related to the processing of the targets, which we correlated with the subjects' ability to detect those targets. This made it possible to distinguish between those stages of visual processing that correlate with human perception and those that do not. The results show that target induced extra-striate feedforward activity peaking at 121 ms does not correlate with perception, whereas more posterior recurrent activity peaking at 160 ms does. Several subsequent stages show an alternating pattern of frontoparietal and occipital activity, all of which correlate highly with perception. This shows that perception emerges early on, but only after an initial feedforward volley, and suggests that multiple reentrant loops are involved in propagating this signal to frontoparietal areas."

To this end, we scanned 58 participants, who performed a masked priming task in which conflicting response tendencies were elicited either consciously (through primes that were weakly masked) or virtually unconsciously (strongly masked primes), with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that individual differences in pre-SMA gray-matter density are related to subjects' ability to voluntary select the correct action in the face of conflict, irrespective of the awareness level of conflict-inducing stimuli.

However, individuals with body integrity identity disorder (BIID) lack this feeling of ownership for distinct limbs and desire amputation of perfectly healthy body parts. This extremely rare condition provides us with an opportunity to study the neural basis underlying the feeling of limb ownership, since these individuals have a feeling of disownership for a limb in the absence of apparent brain damage. Here we directly compared brain activation between limbs that do and do not feel as part of the body using functional MRI during separate tactile stimulation and motor execution experiments. In comparison to matched controls, individuals with BIID showed heightened responsivity of a large somatosensory network including the parietal cortex and right insula during tactile stimulation, regardless of whether the stimulated leg felt owned or alienated. Importantly, activity in the ventral premotor cortex depended on the feeling of ownership and was reduced during stimulation of the alienated compared to the owned leg. In contrast, no significant differences between groups were observed during the performance of motor actions. These results suggest that altered somatosensory processing in the premotor cortex is associated with the feeling of disownership in BIID, which may be related to altered integration of somatosensory and proprioceptive information."

We discuss psychometric models that explicate the relationship between g and the brain in a manner in line with the scientific study of g. Fitting the proposed models to the data, we find that a MIMIC model (for multiple indicators, multiple causes), where the contributions of different brain regions to a unidimensional g are estimated separately, provides the best fit against the data."

This network was recruited during pupil-dilation mimicry compared with interactions without mimicry or compared with pupil-constriction mimicry.

Yet, our brain transforms patterns of light falling on our retina into a coherent percept within a few hundred milliseconds. Possibly, low-level neural responses already carry substantial information to facilitate rapid characterization of the visual input. Here, we computationally estimated low-level contrast responses to computer-generated naturalistic images, and tested whether spatial pooling of these responses could predict image similarity at the neural and behavioral level. Using EEG, we show that statistics derived from pooled responses explain a large amount of variance between single-image evoked potentials (ERPs) in individual subjects. Dissimilarity analysis on multi-electrode ERPs demonstrated that large differences between images in pooled response statistics are predictive of more dissimilar patterns of evoked activity, whereas images with little difference in statistics give rise to highly similar evoked activity patterns. In a separate behavioral experiment, images with large differences in statistics were judged as different categories, whereas images with little differences were confused. These findings suggest that statistics derived from low-level contrast responses can be extracted in early visual processing and can be relevant for rapid judgment of visual similarity. We compared our results with two other, well- known contrast statistics: Fourier power spectra and higher-order properties of contrast distributions (skewness and kurtosis). Interestingly, whereas these statistics allow for accurate image categorization, they do not predict ERP response patterns or behavioral \u2026"

Still, ANNs lack a natural notion of time, and neural units in ANNs exchange analog values in a frame-based manner, a computationally and energetically inefficient form of communication. This contrasts sharply with biological neurons that communicate sparingly and efficiently using isomorphic binary spikes. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can be constructed by replacing the units of an ANN with spiking neurons (Cao et al., ; Diehl et al., ) to obtain reasonable performance, these SNNs use Poisson spiking mechanisms with exceedingly high firing rates compared to their biological counterparts. Here we show how spiking neurons that employ a form of neural coding can be used to construct SNNs that match high-performance ANNs and match or exceed state-of-the-art in SNNs on important benchmarks, while requiring firing rates compatible with biological findings. For this, we use spike-based coding based on the firing rate limiting adaptation phenomenon observed in biological spiking neurons. This phenomenon can be captured in fast adapting spiking neuron models, for which we derive the effective transfer function. Neural units in ANNs trained with this transfer function can be substituted directly with adaptive spiking neurons, and the resulting Adaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) can carry out competitive classification in deep neural networks without further modifications. Adaptive spike-based coding additionally allows for the dynamic control of neural coding precision: we show empirically how a simple model of arousal in \u2026"

While VSTM is usually broken down into iconic memory (brief and high-capacity store) and visual working memory (sustained, yet limited-capacity store), recent studies have suggested the existence of an additional and intermediate form of VSTM that depends on activity in extrastriate cortex. In previous work, we have shown that this fragile form of VSTM can be dissociated from iconic memory. In the present study, we provide evidence that fragile VSTM is different from visual working memory as magnetic stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) disrupts visual working memory, while leaving fragile VSTM intact.

Still, while we define synesthesia as \u2018the mixing of senses\u2019, the great majority of synesthesia studies focus on only one synesthesia type (in particular grapheme-color synesthesia). In this study, a large group of subjects are tested on the presence or absence of different types of synesthesia. Efforts to recruit a representative sample of the Dutch population, not related to or aware of synesthesia as a research topic, helped counter a selection bias or a self-report bias in our subject group. A sharp increase in synesthesia prevalence was found, at least partially due to including many different types of synesthesia in the synesthesia \u2018diagnoses\u2019. The five synesthesia types reported in the Novich et al (2011) study were obtained; Colored Sequences, Colored Music, Colored Sensations, Spatial Sequences, Non-Visual \u2026"

A relatively common type of synesthesia involves perception of color when viewing letters (e.g. the letter \u2018a\u2019 always appears as light blue). In this study, we examine whether traits typically regarded as markers of synesthesia can be acquired by simply reading in color.Non-synesthetes were given specially prepared colored books to read. A modified Stroop task was administered before and after reading. A perceptual crowding task was administered after reading. Reading one book (>49,000 words) was sufficient to induce effects regarded as behavioral markers for synesthesia. The results of the Stroop tasks indicate that it is possible to learn letter-color associations through reading in color (F(1, 14)\u200a=\u200a5.85, p\u200a=\u200a.030). Furthermore, Stroop effects correlated with subjective reports about experiencing letters in color (r(13)\u200a=\u200a0.51, p\u200a=\u200a.05). The frequency of viewing letters is related to the level of association as seen by the difference in the Stroop effect size between upper- and lower-case letters (t(14)\u200a=\u200a2.79, p\u200a=\u200a.014) and in a subgroup of participants whose Stroop effects increased as they continued to read in color. Readers did not show significant performance advantages on the crowding task compared to controls. Acknowledging the many differences between trainees and synesthetes, results suggest that it may be possible to acquire a subset of synesthetic behavioral traits in adulthood through training.To \u2026"

While the behavioral expression of fear at the time of encoding does not predict whether an aversive experience will evolve into long-term fear memory, the application of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) for the analysis of BOLD-MRI data has recently provided a unique marker for memory formation. Here, we aimed to further investigate the utility of this marker by modulating the strength of fear memory with an \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist (yohimbine HCl). Fifty-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to two conditions \u2013 either receiving 20 mg yohimbine or a placebo pill (double-blind) \u2013 prior to differential fear conditioning and MRI-scanning.

We used fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis to compare the neural representations of ambiguous Mooney images before and after they were recognized with their unambiguous grayscale version. Additionally, we administered ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to interfere with this process. Our results demonstrate that after recognition, the pattern of brain activation elicited by a Mooney image is more similar to that of its easily recognizable grayscale version than to the pattern evoked by the identical Mooney image before recognition.

            "abstract": "The cognitive signature of unconscious processes is hotly debated recently. Generally, consciousness is thought to mediate flexible, adaptive and goal-directed behavior, but in the last decade unconscious processing has rapidly gained ground on traditional conscious territory. In this study we demonstrate that the scope and impact of unconscious information on behavior and brain activity can be modulated dynamically on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants performed a Go/No-Go experiment in which an unconscious (masked) stimulus preceding a conscious target could be associated with either a Go or No-Go response. Importantly, the mapping of stimuli onto these actions varied on a trial-by-trial basis, preventing the formation of stable associations and hence the possibility that unconscious stimuli automatically activate these control actions. By eliminating stimulus-response associations established through practice we demonstrate that unconscious information can be processed in a flexible and adaptive manner. In this experiment we show that the same unconscious stimulus can have a substantially different effect on behavior and (prefrontal) brain activity depending on the rapidly changing task context in which it is presented. This work suggests that unconscious information processing shares many sophisticated characteristics (including flexibility and context-specificity) with its conscious counterpart."

Spatially separate segments of such a curve are related to each other through grouping criteria, like collinearity and connectedness. These grouping cues need to be exploited during curve tracing, but it is still an open issue how grouping of contour segments is achieved by the visual system. Many contemporary theories of visual perception assume that grouping operations are carried out pre-attentively, with unlimited capacity. The present study examines this assumption by investigating the involvement of attention in curve tracing. The results show that attention is directed to contour segments that need to be grouped together. The distribution of attention is guided by grouping criteria, such as connectedness. Apparently, attention is required to group spatially separate contour segments into a coherent \u2026"

Global motion perception is one way to study this aspect of ASD. We used plaid motion stimuli, which can be perceived as a coherently moving pattern, requiring feature integration, or as two transparent gratings sliding over each other. If global motion detection is impaired in ASD, this would lead to a decrease of the total time that a coherent pattern is perceived. However, in contrast to other studies in the literature, our results gave no evidence of impaired global motion perception in people with ASD. A reconciliation of the different outcomes is proposed based on spatial frequency processing in ASD."

The structural MRI findings and autism and ADHD self-reports revealed that autism and ADHD symptom severity was correlated with GM volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Autism symptom-severity was correlated with the left posterior cingulate, ADHD with the right parietal lobe, right temporal frontal cortex, bilateral thalamus, and left hippocampus/amygdala complex. Symptom severity of both disorders form a continuum extending into the general population, but it seems to be an oversimplification to typify psychiatric disorders such as autism and ADHD solely as extremes of brain structure abnormalities."

In two electro-encephalography (EEG) experiments, human subjects categorized real-world scenes as manmade or natural (full attention condition) or performed tasks on unrelated stimuli in the center or periphery of the scenes (reduced attention conditions). Scene processing was examined in two ways: traditional trial averaging was used to assess the presence of a categorical manmade/natural distinction in event-related potentials, whereas single-trial analyses assessed whether EEG activity was \u2026"

This property of natural images may facilitate efficient and very rapid extraction of a scenes visual gist. Here we investigate whether a neural response model based on the Weibull contrast distribution captures visual information that humans use to rapidly identify natural scenes. In a learning phase, we measure EEG activity of 32 subjects viewing brief flashes of 800 natural scenes. From these neural measurements and the contrast statistics of the natural image stimuli, we derive an across subject Weibull response model. We use this model to predict the responses to a large set of new scenes and estimate which scene the subject viewed by finding the best match between the model predictions and the observed EEG responses. In almost 90 percent of the cases our model accurately predicts the observed scene. Moreover, in most failed cases, the scene mistaken for the observed scene is visually similar to the observed scene itself. These results suggest that Weibull contrast statistics of natural images contain a considerable amount of scene gist information to warrant rapid identification of natural images."

We found no significant group differences after corrections for multiple comparisons although total WM volume was lower in the group of dyslexics when age was partialled out. We presented an overview of uncorrected clusters of voxels (p\u2009<\u20090.05, cluster size k\u2009>\u2009200) with reduced or increased GM volume.

The condition is hypothesized to be of congenital nature, but evidence for a neuro-anatomical basis is sparse.We collected T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans on a 3T scanner in eight individuals with BIID and 24 matched healthy controls, and analyzed the data using voxel-based morphometry.The results showed reduced grey matter volume in the left dorsal and ventral premotor cortices and larger grey matter volume in the cerebellum (lobule VIIa) in individuals with BIID compared to controls.The premotor cortex and cerebellum are thought to be crucial for the experience of body-ownership and the integration of multisensory information. Our results suggest that BIID is associated with structural brain anomalies and might result from a dysfunction in the integration of multisensory information, leading to the feeling of disunity between the mental and physical body shape."

Using a new texture discrimination task, where surface segregation was varied independently from orientation boundaries, we showed that subjects with ASD scored lower than controls, probably caused by enhanced feedback. Interestingly, performance improved in the ASD group when repeating the task two additional times, indicating a compensation for the imbalance between feedforward and feedback processing."

To date, it remains unresolved where and how in the visual system different stages of figure\u2013ground segregation emerge. Neural correlates of figure border detection have consistently been found in early visual cortex (V1/V2). However, areas V1/V2 have also been frequently associated with later stages of figure\u2013ground segregation (such as border ownership or surface segregation). To causally link activity in early visual cortex to different stages of figure\u2013ground segregation, we briefly disrupted activity in areas V1/V2 at various moments in time using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Prior to stimulation we presented stimuli that made it possible to differentiate between figure border detection and surface segregation.

However, little is known about how variance in the quality of sensory information affects the regulation of controlled actions. In a series of three experiments, comprising a total of seven behavioral studies, we examined how different types of spatial frequency information affect underlying processes of response inhibition and selection. Participants underwent a stop-signal task, a two choice speed/accuracy balance experiment, and a variant of both these tasks where prior information was given about the nature of stimuli. In all experiments, stimuli were either intact, or contained only high-, or low- spatial frequencies. Overall, drift diffusion model analysis showed a decreased rate of information processing when spatial frequencies were removed, whereas the criterion for information accumulation was lowered. When spatial frequency information was intact, the cost of response inhibition increased (longer SSRT), while a correct response was produced faster (shorter reaction times) and with more certainty (decreased errors). When we manipulated the motivation to respond with a deadline (i.e., be fast or accurate), removal of spatial frequency information slowed response times only when instructions emphasized accuracy. However, the slowing of response times did not improve error rates, when compared to fast instruction trials. These behavioral studies suggest that the removal of spatial frequency information differentially affects the speed of response initiation, inhibition, and the efficiency to balance fast or accurate responses.

Decreasing stimulus saliency leads to selective changes in long-latency visually evoked potential components reflecting scene segmentation. These latency changes are accompanied by almost equal changes in simple RTs and points of subjective simultaneity.

PCA was performed to extract factor structures (FS) of the current dataset using both item scores and facet scores. Correlational network graphs were constructed from univariate correlation matrices of interactions between both items and facets. These networks were pruned in a link-by-link fashion while calculating the network community structure (NCS) of each resulting network using the Wakita Tsurumi clustering algorithm.

In this paper, we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action.To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on \u2026"

Blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in monkeys can abolish neural signals related to figure-ground segregation and feature integration. However, it is unknown whether this also affects perceptual integration itself. Therefore, we tested whether ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces feature integration in humans. We administered a subanesthetic dose of ketamine to healthy subjects who performed a texture discrimination task in a placebo-controlled double blind within-subject design. We found that ketamine significantly impaired performance on the texture discrimination task compared to the placebo condition, while performance on a control fixation task was much less impaired. This effect is not merely due to task difficulty or a difference in sedation levels. We are the first to show a behavioral effect on feature integration by manipulating the NMDA receptor in humans. "

Commonly used read-outs of associative fear learning are the fear-potentiated startle reflex (FPS), pupil dilation and US-expectancy ratings. FPS is thought to reflect the affective aspect of fear learning, while pupil dilation reflects a general arousal response. However, in order to measure FPS, aversively loud acoustic probes are presented during conditioning, which might in itself exert an effect on fear learning. Here we tested the effect of startle probes on fear learning by comparing brain activation (fMRI), pupil dilation and US-expectancy ratings with and without acoustic startle probes within subjects. Regardless of startle probes, fear conditioning resulted in enhanced dACC, insula and ventral striatum activation. Interaction analyses showed that startle probes \u2026"

To be reliable, these clues should ideally be invariant to common viewing variations such as changes in illumination and orientation. In a large image database of natural materials, we found textures with low-level contrast statistics that varied substantially under viewing variations, as well as textures that remained relatively constant. This led us to ask whether textures with constant contrast statistics give rise to more invariant representations compared to other textures. To test this, we selected natural texture images with either high (HV) or low (LV) variance in contrast statistics and presented these to human observers. In two distinct behavioral categorization paradigms, participants more often judged HV textures as \u201cdifferent\u201d compared to LV textures, showing that textures with constant contrast statistics are perceived as being more invariant. In a separate electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment, evoked responses to single texture images (single-image ERPs) were collected. The results show that differences in contrast statistics correlated with both early and late differences in occipital ERP amplitude between individual images. Importantly, ERP differences between images of HV textures were mainly driven by illumination angle, which was not the case for LV images: there, differences were completely driven by texture membership. These converging neural and behavioral results imply that some natural textures are surprisingly invariant to illumination changes and that low-level contrast statistics are diagnostic of the extent of this invariance."

Therefore, we tested whether sustained processing of emotional expressions, especially threat-related expressions, would attenuate neural adaptation. Neutral and emotional expressions (happy, mixed and fearful) of same and different identity were presented at 3 Hz. We used electroencephalography to record the evoked steady-state visual potentials (ssVEP) and tested to what extent the ssVEP amplitude adapts to the same when compared with different face identities. We found adaptation to the identity of a neutral face. However, for emotional faces, adaptation was reduced, decreasing linearly with negative valence, with the least adaptation to fearful \u2026"

Yet disruption of neural responses in early visual cortex beyond feed-forward processing stages affects object recognition performance. Here, we unite these discrepant findings by reporting that object recognition involves enhanced feedback activity (recurrent processing within early visual cortex) when target objects are embedded in natural scenes that are characterized by high complexity. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on natural scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was selectively enhanced for high complexity scenes. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was enhanced for target objects in scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by target objects were selectively enhanced at feedback stages of visual processing (from ~220 ms onwards) for high complexity scenes only. Third, behavioral performance for high complexity scenes deteriorated when participants were pressed for time and thus less able to incorporate the feedback activity. Modeling of the reaction time distributions using drift diffusion revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes, with evidence accumulation being coupled to trial-to-trial variation in the EEG feedback response \u2026"

This performance suggests that the analysis of a loose collection of image features could support the recognition of natural object categories, without dedicated systems to solve specific visual subtasks. Research in humans however suggests that while feedforward activity may suffice for sparse scenes with isolated objects, additional visual operations ('routines') that aid the recognition process (e.g. segmentation or grouping) are needed for more complex scenes. Linking human visual processing to performance of DCNNs with increasing depth, we here explored if, how, and when object information is differentiated from the backgrounds they appear on. To this end, we controlled the information in both objects and backgrounds, as well as the relationship between them by adding noise, manipulating background congruence and systematically occluding parts of the image. Results indicate that with an increase in network depth, there is an increase in the distinction between object- and background information. For more shallow networks, results indicated a benefit of training on segmented objects. Overall, these results indicate that, de facto, scene segmentation can be performed by a network of sufficient depth. We conclude that the human brain could perform scene segmentation in the context of object identification without an explicit mechanism, by selecting or \u201cbinding\u201d features that belong to the object and ignoring other features, in a manner similar to a very deep \u2026"

Recently, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has become popular for decoding cognitive states from distributed patterns of neural activation. Here, we used this technique to assess whether biased fear generalization, characteristic of clinical fear, is already present during the initial perception and categorization of a stimulus, or emerges during the subsequent interpretation of a stimulus. Individuals with low spider fear (n = 20) and high spider fear (n = 18) underwent functional MRI scanning while viewing series of schematic flowers morphing to spiders. In line with previous studies, individuals with high fear of spiders were behaviorally more likely to classify ambiguous morphs as spiders than individuals with low fear of spiders. Univariate analyses of BOLD-MRI data revealed stronger activation toward spider pictures in high fearful individuals compared to low fearful individuals in numerous areas. Yet, neither average activation, nor support vector machine classification (i.e., a form of MVPA) matched the behavioral results \u2013 i.e., a biased response toward ambiguous stimuli \u2013 in any of the regions of interest. This may point to limitations of the current design, and to challenges associated with classifying emotional and neutral stimuli in groups that \u2026"

How the brain computationally represents intermediate features is still unclear. To further elucidate this, we compared the biologically plausible HMAX model and Bag of Words (BoW) model from computer vision. Both these computational models use visual dictionaries, candidate features of intermediate complexity, to represent visual scenes, and the models have been proven effective in automatic object and scene recognition. These models however differ in the computation of visual dictionaries and pooling techniques. We investigated where in the brain and to what extent human fMRI responses to short video can be accounted for by multiple hierarchical levels of the HMAX and BoW models. Brain activity of 20 subjects obtained while viewing a short video clip was analyzed voxel-wise using a distance-based variation partitioning method. Results revealed that both HMAX and BoW explain a significant amount of brain activity in early visual regions V1, V2, and V3. However, BoW exhibits more consistency across subjects in accounting for brain activity compared to HMAX. Furthermore, visual dictionary representations by HMAX and BoW explain significantly some brain activity in higher areas which are believed to process intermediate features. Overall our results indicate that, although both HMAX and BoW account for activity in the human visual system, the BoW seems to more faithfully represent neural responses in low and intermediate level visual areas of the brain."

So far, only behavioral studies into MIT have been undertaken. These studies have left a fundamental question regarding MIT unanswered, is MIT a one-stage or a two-stage process? According to the one-stage model, after a location has been attended, the identity is released without effort. However, according to the two-stage model, there are two effortful stages in MIT, attending to a location, and attending to the identity of the object at that location. In the current study we investigated this question by measuring brain activity in response to tracking familiar and unfamiliar targets. Familiarity is known to automate effortful processes, so if attention to identify the object is needed, this should become easier. However, if no such attention is needed, familiarity can only affect other processes (such as memory for the target set). Our results revealed that on unfamiliar trials neural activity was higher in both attentional networks, and visual identification networks. These results suggest that familiarity in MIT automates attentional identification processes, thus suggesting that attentional identification is needed in MIT. This then would imply that MIT is essentially a two-stage process, since after attending the location, the identity does not seem to come for free."

            "abstract": "The speed of contour integration was investigated in a task, which can be solved by grouping contour segments into elongated curves. Subjects had to detect a continuous curve, which could be intersected by one or two other curves. At locations where these curves came in close proximity, the assignment of contour segments to the different curves could be based on colinearity. Reaction times exhibited a strong dependence on (1) the presence of intersections among curves, and (2) the context provided by the stimulus set from which individual stimuli were selected. Reaction times were shortest when grouping ot contour segments depended on information at a single location in the visual field. In this condition, responses to stimuli containing an intersection were faster than responses to stimuli that did not. When responses were determined by information from spatially separate locations, responses were delayed, and every intersection slowed the reaction time considerably. This result contrasts with earlier investigations which have suggested that contour integration on the basis of colinearity is performed pre attentively (Field et al., 1993; Kovacs &] ulesz, 1993), but is in accordance with studies on curve tracing (eg Jolicoeur et al., 1986). We propose that the assignment of contour segments to equally coherent curves, a process that may be called figure-figure segregation, is a function of object based attention. Moreover, the protracted reaction times lor some of the stimuli indicate that spread of attention within an object costs time. This implies that object recognition is not always as fast as is sometimes assumed."

Unlike most other methods that estimate effective connectivity, an AG is able to explicitly model missing brain regions in a network model. We compared AGs with the conventional structural equation models (SEM). We used both methods to estimate connection strengths between six regions of interest of the visual cortex based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a motion perception task. In order to examine which method is more accurate to estimate effective connectivity, we compared the connection strengths of the AG and SEM models with connection probabilities resulting from probabilistic tractography obtained from diffusion tensor images. This was done by correlating the connection strengths of the best fitting AG and SEM models with the connection probabilities of the probabilistic \u2026"

Non-synesthetes read specially prepared books with colored letters for several weeks and were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. If the acquired letter-color associations were visual in nature, then brain activation in visual cortex while viewing the trained black letters (compared to untrained black letters) should predict the strength of the associations, the quality of the color experience, or the vividness of visual mental imagery.

Unlike simplified, artificial stimuli, real-world scenes contain low-level regularities that are informative about the structural complexity, which the brain could exploit. In this study, participants performed an animal detection task on low, medium or high complexity scenes as determined by two biologically plausible natural scene statistics, contrast energy (CE) or spatial coherence (SC).

En als dat zo is, komt dat doordat mannen nu eenmaal gevoeliger zijn voor seksuele prikkels dan vrouwen, of laten vrouwen seksuele gevoelens minder toe, laten ze hun gedrag er minder door bepalen, met andere woorden: zetten vrouwen eerder de rem op seksuele gevoelens dan mannen?

The promise of CNNs is at least two-fold. First, they represent the best engineering solution to successfully tackle the foundational task of visual categorization with a performance level that even exceeds that of humans. Second, for computational neuroscience, CNNs provide a testable modelling platform for visual categorizations inspired by the multi-layered organization of visual cortex. Here, we used a 3D generative model to control the variance of information learned to identify 2,000 face identities in one CNN architecture (10-layer ResNet). We generated 25M face images to train the network by randomly sampling intrinsic (ie face morphology, gender, age, expression and ethnicity) and extrinsic factors of face variance (ie 3D pose, illumination, scale and 2D translation). At testing, the network performed with 99% generalization accuracy for face identity across variations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. State-of-the-art information mapping techniques from psychophysics (ie Representational Similarity Analysis and Bubbles) revealed respectively the network layer at which factors of variance are resolved and the face features that are used for identity. By explicitly controlling the generative factors of face information, we provide an alternative framework based on human psychophysics to understand information processing in CNNs."

And even when attended, stimuli may not always be reportable, for instance when they are masked. A stimulus can thus be unreportable for different reasons: the absence of attention or the absence of a conscious percept. But to what extent does the brain learn from exposure to these unreportable stimuli? In this fMRI experiment subjects were exposed to textured figure-ground stimuli, of which reportability was manipulated either by masking (which only interferes with consciousness) or with an inattention paradigm (which only interferes with attention). One day later learning was assessed neurally and behaviorally. Positive neural learning effects were found for stimuli presented in the inattention paradigm; for attended yet masked stimuli negative adaptation effects were found. Interestingly, these inattentional learning effects only became apparent in a second session after a behavioral detection task had been administered during which performance feedback was provided. This suggests that the memory trace that is formed during inattention is latent until reactivated by behavioral practice. However, no behavioral learning effects were found, therefore we cannot conclude that perceptual learning has taken place for these unattended stimuli."

            "abstract": "The ability of the human brain to extract meaningful information from complex natural scenes in less amount of time than from simple, artificial stimuli is one of the great mysteries of vision. One prominent example of this ability is that natural scenes containing animals lead to a frontal ERP difference compared to scenes without animals as soon as 150 ms after stimulus-onset (Thorpe et al., 1996). Whereas these findings make clear that the brain is able to very rapidly distinguish these types of images, it is unclear on the basis of what information this distinction is made-in other words, whether early differences in the ERP between natural stimuli are related to low-level or high-level information in natural images. We have shown previously that the early animal vs. non-animal difference is driven by low-level image statistics of local contrast correlations, as captured by two parameters (beta and gamma) of the Weibull fit \u2026"

            "abstract": "Arousal levels strongly affect task performance. Yet, what arousal level is optimal for a task depends on its difficulty. Easy task performance peaks at higher arousal levels, whereas performance on difficult tasks displays an inverted U-shape relationship with arousal, peaking at medium arousal levels, an observation first made by Yerkes and Dodson in 1908. It is commonly proposed that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus system regulates these effects on performance through a widespread release of noradrenaline resulting in changes of cortical gain. This account, however, does not explain why performance decays with high arousal levels only in difficult, but not in simple tasks. Here, we present a mechanistic model that revisits the Yerkes-Dodson effect from a sensory perspective: a deep convolutional neural network augmented with a global gain mechanism reproduced the same interaction between arousal state and task difficulty in its performance. Investigating this model revealed that global gain states differentially modulated sensory information encoding across the processing hierarchy, which explained their differential effects on performance on simple versus difficult tasks. These findings offer a novel hierarchical sensory processing account of how, and why, arousal state affects task performance."

In the MTL, PER provides input to the hippocampal formation directly and via the entorhinal cortex (EC), whereas in the VVS, PER is considered to be at the top of the visual processing hierarchy of object information. Because of its position in both networks, PER presumably serves a role in memory and visual perception. PER's perceptual role is thought to be contingent upon the complexity of visual information, i.e., PER only becomes active in visual perception when many higher order visual cues are combined. Using high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated the effect of varying the presence of binocular disparity, in complex visual object stimuli. Nineteen subjects were presented with movies of complex objects and a fixation cross, either with or without binocular disparity \u2026"

We directly contrast effects of precision (internal noise suppression) and two different gain modulation mechanisms on performance on a visual search task with complex real-world images. Unlike standard artificial neurons, biological neurons have saturating activation functions, permitting implementation of attentional gain as gain on a neuron's input or on its outgoing connection. We show that modulating the connection is most effective in selectively enhancing information processing by redistributing spiking activity and by introducing additional task-relevant information, as shown by \u2026"

Neuroscientific studies of fluid intelligence have studied both fluid intelligence tasks of varying difficulty and individual differences in fluid intelligence ability, but have failed to appropriately distinguish the two dimensions. Here we use task-based fMRI (N=34) to show that within and between subject dimensions show both partial overlap and widespread differences. Individuals with higher ability showed widespread increased activity including bilateral frontoparietal systems, whereas more difficult items were associated with more focal activity increases in middle frontal gyri, frontal poles and superior frontal poles. Finally, we show that when difficulty is equated across individuals, those with higher ability tend to show more fronto-parietal activity, whereas low fluid intelligence individuals tend to show greater activity in higher visual areas.

In this article, we tested a form of recurrence in deep residual networks (ResNets) to capture recurrent processing signals in the human brain. Although ResNets are feedforward networks, they approximate an excitatory additive form of recurrence. Essentially, this form of recurrence consists of repeating excitatory activations in response to a static stimulus. Here, we used ResNets of varying depths (reflecting varying levels of recurrent processing) to explain EEG activity within a visual masking paradigm.

Here, we describe a variant of Batch Normalization, LocalNorm, that regularizes the normalization layer in the spirit of Dropout during training, while dynamically adapting to the local image intensity and contrast at test-time.

Next, we show that it is also possible to make these predictions on the basis of storyboards.

However, currently, it is unclear to what extent MRS measures reflect stable trait-like neurotransmitter levels, or may be sensitive to the brain\u2019s activity state as well. Therefore, this study investigated if cortical GABA (GABA+/Cr) and Glutamate (Glx/Cr) levels differ as a function of task demand, and if so, in which activity state these measures may best predict behavioral performance. We acquired 3T-MRS data from thirty healthy men in two brain areas during different task demands: the medial occipital cortex (OC), at rest (eyes closed) and while subjects watched a movie (on-task); and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC), at rest, during an easy working memory (WM) task, and during a challenging WM task. Task demand had no effect on the concentration of GABA or Glutamate in either brain region. Moreover, we observed no correlations between GABA and Glutamate concentrations and behavioral performance; occipital neurotransmitter concentrations did not predict visual discrimination nor did those in lDLPFC predict WM updating accuracy, capacity or maintenance. These null findings were supported by Bayesian statistics. In conclusion, these results suggest that with 3T-MRS we measure relatively stable trait-like neurotransmitter concentrations, but at the same time question the validity of 3T-MRS as a method to relate GABA and Glutamate concentrations to behavior."

This ability is showcased by the fact that observers succeed at recognizing objects in rapidly changing image sequences, at up to 13 ms/image. To date, the mechanisms that govern dynamic object recognition remain poorly understood. Here, we developed deep learning models for dynamic recognition and compared different computational mechanisms, contrasting feedforward and recurrent, single-image and sequential processing as well as different forms of adaptation. We found that only models that integrate images sequentially via lateral recurrence mirrored human performance (N = 36) and were predictive of trial-by-trial responses across image durations (13\u201380 ms/image). Importantly, models with sequential lateral-recurrent integration also captured how human performance changes as a function of image presentation durations, with models processing images for a few time steps capturing human object recognition at shorter presentation durations and models processing images for more time steps capturing human object recognition at longer presentation durations. Furthermore, augmenting such a recurrent model with adaptation markedly improved dynamic recognition performance and accelerated its representational dynamics, thereby predicting human trial-by-trial responses using fewer processing resources. Together, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms rendering object recognition so fast and effective in a dynamic visual world."

However, the degree to which CNNs can predict temporal dynamics of visual object recognition reflected in neural measures with millisecond precision is less understood. Additionally, while deeper CNNs with higher numbers of layers perform better on automated object recognition, it is unclear if this also results into better correlation to brain responses. Here, we examined 1) to what extent CNN layers predict visual evoked responses in the human brain over time and 2) whether deeper CNNs better model brain responses. Specifically, we tested how well CNN architectures with 7 (CNN-7) and 15 (CNN-15) layers predicted electro-encephalography (EEG) responses to several thousands of natural images. Our results show that both CNN architectures correspond to EEG responses in a hierarchical spatio-temporal manner, with lower layers explaining responses early in time at electrodes overlying early visual cortex, and higher layers explaining responses later in time at electrodes overlying lateral-occipital cortex. While the explained variance of neural responses by individual layers did not differ between CNN-7 and CNN-15, combining the representations across layers resulted in improved performance of CNN-15 compared to CNN-7, but only after 150 ms after stimulus-onset. This suggests that CNN representations reflect both early (feed-forward) and late (feedback) stages of visual processing. Overall \u2026"

Being the victim of a violent robbery will usually result in a strong memory for that event. This is in principle adaptive: the ability to store relevant information prepares us for future events and promotes survival1, 2. However, long-\u2010lasting memory for emotional experiences can also become dysfunctional such as in anxiety disorders.The classic model to study fear learning and memory is Pavlovian fear conditioning3, which is well suited for research across species1, 4. In this paradigm an initially neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS+; eg, a picture of a face) is repeatedly paired with an intrinsically aversive stimulus(unconditioned stimulus, UCS; eg, an electric shock), while another conditioned stimulus (CS-\u2010; eg, a picture of another face) is never paired with the UCS. With sufficient CS+/UCS pairings, the CS+ acquires the same aversive qualities as the UCS and will elicit a conditioned fear response(CR) on its own. After repeated presentations of the CS+ without the UCS, the fear response usually diminishes, a process that is referred to as \u2018extinction learning\u2019. In animals, fear responses are typically measured by assessing the amount of freezing in response to the CS, or avoidance behavior; in humans common measures include skin conductance responses, acoustic startle responses, heart rate, pupil dilation responses, action tendencies and verbal report (for an alternative use of the term\u2018fear\u2019, see LeDoux5)."

Our study aimed to investigate the factors contributing to the predictive power of DCNNs in object categorization tasks. We compared the activity of four DCNN architectures with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings obtained from 62 human subjects during an object categorization task. Previous physiological studies on object categorization have highlighted the importance of figure-ground segregation - the ability to distinguish objects from their backgrounds. Therefore, we set out to investigate if figureground segregation could explain DCNNs predictive power. Using a stimuli set consisting of identical target objects embedded in different backgrounds, we examined the influence of object background versus object category on both EEG and DCNN activity. Crucially, the recombination of naturalistic objects and experimentally-controlled backgrounds creates a sufficiently challenging and naturalistic task, while allowing us to retain experimental control. Our results showed that early EEG activity (<100ms) and early DCNN layers represent object background rather than object category. We also found that the predictive power of DCNNs on EEG activity is related to processing of object backgrounds, rather than categories. We provided evidence from both trained and untrained (i.e. random weights) DCNNs, showing figure-ground segregation to be a crucial step prior to the learning of object features. These findings suggest that both human visual cortex and \u2026"

Whereas for an easy task, perceptual performance linearly increases with higher arousal levels, for a more challenging task, an inverted-U-shaped relationship has been described. These findings are commonly referred to as the Yerkes-Dodson law (1908). Yet, it remains unclear why perceptual performance decays with high levels of arousal in difficult but not in simple tasks. Based on recent studies linking a global gain change in sensory processing to changes in arousal state, we augmented a deep convolutional neural network with a global gain mechanism to mimic the effects of cortical arousal. With this approach, we show that the Yerkes-Dodson law can be accounted for by this global gain mechanism, acting on a hierarchical sensory system that processes stimuli of varying sensory complexity. By leveraging the full observability of our model, we reconcile conflicting findings from previous studies on sensory processing, by showing that both linear as well inverted-U-shaped gain profiles emerge in the interaction of hierarchical sensory processing and global arousal changes."

Whereas the behavioral mechanisms underlying competition are well documented, its neurocognitive underpinnings remain poorly understood. We addressed this using neuroimaging and computational modeling of individual investment decisions aimed at exploiting one's counterpart (\u201cattack\u201d) or at protecting against exploitation by one's counterpart (\u201cdefense\u201d). Analyses revealed that during attack relative to defense (i) individuals invest less and are less successful; (ii) computations of expected reward are strategically more sophisticated (reasoning level k = 4 vs. k = 3 during defense); (iii) ventral striatum activity tracks reward prediction errors; (iv) risk prediction errors were not correlated with neural activity in either ROI or whole-brain analyses; and (v) successful exploitation correlated with neural activity in the bilateral ventral striatum, left OFC, left anterior insula, left TPJ, and lateral occipital cortex. We conclude that, in economic contests, coming out ahead (vs. not falling behind) involves sophisticated strategic reasoning that engages both reward and value computation areas and areas associated with theory of mind."

This computational model uses visual word histograms, candidate features of intermediate complexity, to represent visual scenes, and has proven effective in automatic object and scene recognition. We analyzed where in the brain and to what extent human fMRI responses to natural scenes can be accounted for by BoW representations. Voxel-wise application of a distance-based variation partitioning method reveals that BoW representations explain brain activity in visual areas V1, V2 and in particular V4. Area V4 is known to be tuned for features of intermediate complexity, suggesting that the BoW model captures intermediate-level scene representations in the human brain."

Together, these processes result in a surface representation of the visual image in which some surfaces of the visual scene are assigned as figure and other surfaces are assigned as ground, and as such contribute to the perceptual interpretation of a scene. This figure\u2013ground relation is characterized by three aspects:(1) the figure appears to be located in front of the ground,(2) the local discontinuity between figure and ground is perceived as belonging to the figure (the figure has ownership of the border), and (3) the ground appears to continue behind the figure \u2026"

            "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) perform increasingly well on visual tasks like object recognition while also closely aligning with human brain activity. However, model behaviour also differs from human behaviour in important ways. One prominent example of this difference is that DCNNs trained on ImageNet exhibit a texture bias, while humans are consistently biased towards object shape. Previous work suggests DCNN shape bias can be increased by training on purposely designed stimuli (eg stylized images). Here, we present an alternative method that reduces texture bias: pre-training on high-resolution natural images that more closely approximate human visual experience. Our training pipeline needs no data augmentation but solely relies on visual features that occur in everyday scenes. Our method and dataset provide an opportunity to build DCNNs that operate on high-resolution images and may aid in closing the gap between human visual processing and DCNNs."

Natural images exhibit much statistical regularity, one of which is present in the distribution of local contrast values. It has been observed (Simoncelli, 1999; Geusebroek and Smeulders, 2002, 2005) that properties that are inherent to natural images, such as spatial fragmentation (generated by the edges between the objects in the scene) and local correlations (due to edges belonging to objects in the image) results in contrast distributions that range between power law and Gaussian shapes, and therefore conform to a Weibull distribution. This regularity (systematic variation in the contrast distribution of natural images) can therefore be adequately captured by fitting a Weibull function of the following form:(f) ce p=() \u03b2 f\u2212 \u03bc \u03b3Where\u200b c\u200b is a normalization constant that transforms the frequency distribution into a probability distribution. The parameter \ud835\udf07, denoting the origin of the contrast distribution, is generally close to zero for natural images. We normalize out this parameter by subtracting the smallest contrast value from the contrast data, leaving two free parameters per image, \ud835\udefd (\u200b beta\u200b) and \ud835\udefe (\u200b gamma\u200b), that represent the scale (\u200b beta\u200b) and shape (\u200b gamma\u200b) of the distribution (Geusebroek & Smeulders, 2002, 2005). Beta varies with the range of contrast strengths present in the image, whereas gamma varies with the degree of correlation between contrasts."
