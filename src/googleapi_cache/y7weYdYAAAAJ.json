            "abstract": "During discourse comprehension, every new word adds to an evolving representation of meaning that accumulates over consecutive sentences and constrains the next words. To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word 'she', to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells' preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension. This study uniquely demonstrates, at the single-cell level, how memory and language are linked."

            "abstract": "Natural scenes usually contain a vast number of objects that need to be segmented and segregated from each other and from the background to guide behaviour. In the visual brain, object-based attention is the process by which image fragments belonging to the same objects are grouped together. The curve-tracing task is a special case of a perceptual grouping task that tests our ability to group image elements of an elongated curve. The task consists in determining which image elements belong to the same curve, and in the brain, neurons spread an enhanced activity level over the representation of the relevant curve. A previous \"growth-cone model of attention\" accounted for the scale invariance of tracing by proposing that the enhanced activity propagates at multiple levels of the visual cortical hierarchy. However, the precise neuronal circuitry for learning and implementing scale-invariant tracing remains unknown. We propose a new recurrent architecture for the scale-invariant labelling of curves and objects. The architecture is composed of a feedforward pathway that dynamically selects the right scale and prevents the spilling over of the enhanced activity to other curves, and a recurrent pathway for tag spreading that involves horizontal and feedback interactions, mediated by a disinhibitory loop involving VIP and SOM interneurons. We trained the network with curves up to seven pixels long using reinforcement learning and a learning rule local in time and space and we found that it generalized to curves of any length and to spatially extended objects. The network chose the appropriate scale and switched to higher or lower scales as \u2026"

In contrast, non-human primates exhibit very limited proficiency in recognizing abstract representations. This research delves into this human singularity for visual abstraction, through neuroimaging experiments conducted in both humans and non-human primates. Stimuli presenting the same concept (e.g. a house or a face) but varying in abstraction levels (photos, drawings, symbols, and words) were initially presented to a monkey, while intracranial recording of his brain were obtained (16 Utah arrays distributed in V1, V4 and IT). Preliminary results indicate that monkey display early signs of abstraction, particularly for evolutionarily ancient categories such as faces. MEG and fMRI recordings of human subjects are also currently underway, striving to unveil the neuronal mechanisms that set our species apart in the domain of visual abstraction."

The nature of this contextual information is difficult to study, as responses to feedforward and top-down inputs overlap in time and are difficult to disentangle experimentally. To address this issue, we measured responses to natural images and partially occluded versions of these images in the visual cortex of mice. Assessing neuronal responses before and after familiarizing mice with the non-occluded images allowed us to study experience-dependent and stimulus-specific contextual responses in pyramidal cells (PyCs) in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 in the absence of feedforward input. Surprisingly, in the same retinotopic region of cortex, we found that separate populations of PyCs in layer 2/3 responded to occluded and non-occluded images. Responses of PyCs selective for occluded images were strengthened upon familiarization and decoding analysis revealed they contained image-specific information, suggesting that they signaled the absence of predicted visual stimuli. Responses of PyCs selective for non-occluded scenes were weaker for familiarized images but stronger for unfamiliar images, suggesting that these neurons signaled the presence of unpredicted visual stimuli. Layer 5 also contained PyCs preferring either feedforward or contextual inputs, but their responses were more complex and strengthening of responses to occluded images required task engagement. The results show that visual experience decreases the activity of neurons responding to known feedforward inputs but increases the activity of neurons responding to \u2026"

When subproblems are solved, relevant intermediate results need to be stored by neurons and propagated to the next subproblem, until the overarching goal has been completed. We will here consider visual tasks, which can be decomposed into sequences of elemental visual operations. Experimental evidence suggests that intermediate results of the elemental operations are stored in working memory as an enhancement of neural activity in the visual cortex. The focus of enhanced activity is then available for subsequent operations to act upon. The main question at stake is how the elemental operations and their sequencing can emerge in neural networks that are trained with only rewards, in a reinforcement learning setting. We here propose a new recurrent neural network architecture that can learn composite visual tasks that require the application of successive elemental operations. Specifically, we selected three tasks for which electrophysiological recordings of monkeys\u2019 visual cortex are available. To train the networks, we used RELEARNN, a biologically plausible four-factor Hebbian learning rule, which is local both in time and space. We report that networks learn elemental operations, such as contour grouping and visual search, and execute sequences of operations, solely based on the characteristics of the visual stimuli and the reward structure of a task. After training was completed, the activity of the units of the neural network elicited by behaviorally relevant image items was stronger than that elicited by irrelevant ones \u2026"

To this end, multi-unit activity (MUA) of macaque visual cortex was recorded in a passive fixation task upon presentation of faces and natural images. We analyzed the relationship between MUA and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including the conventional and feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i.e., z- and w-latents of StyleGAN, respectively) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled w representations outperform both z and CLIP representations in explaining neural responses. Further, w-latent features were found to be positioned at the higher end of the complexity gradient which indicates that they capture visual information relevant to high-level neural activity. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding."

Noting that various theories often try to explain different aspects or mechanistic levels of consciousness, we argue that the theories do not necessarily contradict each other. Instead, several of them may converge on fundamental neuronal mechanisms and be partly compatible and complementary, so that multiple theories can simultaneously contribute to our understanding.

Two-photon calcium imaging and convolutional neural network modeling revealed that ChCs are visually responsive but weakly selective for stimulus content. In mice running in a virtual tunnel, ChCs respond strongly to events known to elicit arousal, including locomotion and visuomotor mismatch. Repeated exposure of the mice to the virtual tunnel was accompanied by reduced visual responses of ChCs and structural plasticity of ChC boutons and axon initial segment length. Finally, ChCs only weakly inhibited pyramidal cells. These findings \u2026"

We present a comprehensive method to optimize electrode placement for visual prostheses, with the objective of aligning with predetermined phosphene distributions. Our approach relies on individual anatomy data to minimize discrepancies between simulated and target phosphene patterns. While tailored for a 1000-channel 3D electrode array in V1, our algorithm is versatile, potentially accommodating any electrode design. Notably, our results show individually optimized placements outperform average brain solutions, underscoring the significance of anatomical specificity. Nevertheless, challenges persist in achieving comprehensive visual field coverage owing to current electrode constraints.

A variety of theories aiming to answer this age-old question have emerged from the recent surge in consciousness research, and some are now hotly debated. While most researchers have so far focused on the development and validation of their preferred theory in relative isolation, this article, written by a group of scientists representing different theories, takes an alternative approach. Noting that various theories often try to explain different aspects or mechanistic levels of consciousness, we argue that theories do not necessarily contradict each other. Instead, several of them may converge on fundamental neuronal mechanisms and be partly compatible and complementary, so that multiple theories can simultaneously contribute to our understanding. Here we consider unifying, integration-oriented approaches that have so far been largely neglected, seeking to combine valuable elements from various theories."

Although the visual cortex plays an important role in object detection, the superior colliculus can support detection when the visual cortex is ablated or silenced. Moreover, it has been shown that superficial layers of mouse SC (sSC) encode visual features of complex objects, and that this code is not inherited from the primary visual cortex. This suggests that mouse sSC may provide a significant contribution to complex object vision. Here, we use optogenetics to show that mouse sSC is involved in figure detection based on differences in figure contrast, orientation, and phase. Additionally, our neural recordings show that in mouse sSC, image elements that belong to a figure elicit stronger activity than those same elements when they are part of the background. The discriminability of this neural code is higher for correct trials than for incorrect trials. Our results provide new insight into the behavioral relevance of the visual processing that takes place in sSC."

Using viral tracing we found that V1 ChCs predominantly receive monosynaptic input from local layer 5 pyramidal cells and higher-order cortical regions. Two-photon calcium imaging and convolutional neural network modelling revealed that ChCs are visually responsive but weakly selective for stimulus content. In mice running in a virtual tunnel, ChCs respond strongly to events known to elicit arousal, including locomotion and visuomotor mismatch. Repeated exposure of the mice to the virtual tunnel was accompanied by reduced visual responses of ChCs and structural plasticity of ChC boutons and axon initial segment length. Finally, ChCs only weakly inhibited pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that ChCs provide an arousal-related signal to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells that may modulate their activity and/or gate plasticity of their axon initial segments during behaviorally relevant events."

Our encoding analysis revealed that the -latent representations of feature-disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most effective candidate for predicting neural responses to images. Importantly, the usage of synthesized yet photorealistic images allowed for superior control over these data as their underlying latent representations were known a priori rather than approximated post-hoc. As such, we leveraged this property in neural reconstruction of the perceived images. Taken together with the fact that the (unsupervised) generative models themselves were never optimized on neural data, these results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement and unsupervised training as driving factors in shaping neural representations."

This view allows separate communication channels between different brain areas. Another hypothesis is that binding of features that are represented in different brain regions occurs when the neurons in these areas that respond to the same object simultaneously enhance their firing rate, which would correspond to directing object-based attention to these features.

They differed between the three main classes of inhibitory neurons, with particularly strong contextual drive of VIP neurons, indicating a contribution of disinhibitory circuits to contextual drive.

            "abstract": "During visual search, it is important to reduce the interference of distracting objects in the scene. The neuronal responses elicited by the search target stimulus are typically enhanced. However, it is equally important to suppress the representations of distracting stimuli, especially if they are salient and capture attention. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement to a unique \u201cpop-out\u201d shape stimulus among an array of distracting stimuli. One of these distractors had a salient color that varied across trials and differed from the color of the other stimuli, causing it to also pop-out. The monkeys were able to select the pop-out shape target with high accuracy and actively avoided the pop-out color distractor. This behavioral pattern was reflected in the activity of neurons in area V4. Responses to the shape targets were enhanced, while the activity evoked by the pop-out color distractor was only briefly enhanced, directly \u2026"

            "abstract": "Detailed characterization of interneuron subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) has greatly contributed to understanding visual perception, yet the role of chandelier cells (ChCs) in visual processing remains poorly characterized. Using viral tracing we found that V1 ChCs predominantly receive monosynaptic input from local layer 5 pyramidal cells and higher-order cortical regions. Two-photon calcium imaging and convolutional neural network modelling revealed that ChCs are visually responsive but weakly selective for stimulus content. In mice running in a virtual tunnel, ChCs respond strongly to locomotion and halting visual flow, suggesting arousal-related activity. Visuomotor experience in the tunnel diminished visual responses of ChCs and induced structural plasticity of ChC boutons and axon initial segment length. Finally, ChCs only weakly inhibited pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that ChCs provide an arousal-related signal to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells that may modulate their activity and/or gate plasticity of their axon initial segments during behaviorally relevant events."

Phosphene locations matched the receptive fields of stimulated neurons, and V4 activity predicted phosphene detection during stimulation in V1. Lastly, we stimulated multiple electrodes simultaneously to generate percepts composed of multiple phosphenes.

So far, the focus has been on how ANNs can help to explain the tuning of neurons at various stages of the visual cortical hierarchy. However, the role of modulatory feedback connections, which play a role in attention and perceptual organization, has not been tested yet. Here, we present a biologically plausible neural network that performs scene segmentation and can shift attention using modulatory feedback connections from higher to lower brain areas. The model replicates several neurophysiological signatures of recurrent processing. Specifically, figural regions elicit more neuronal activity in model units than the background. The modulation of neuronal activity by figure and ground occurs at a delay after the first feedforward response, because it depends on a loop through the higher model areas. Importantly, the enhancement of the figural response is controlled by object-based attention, which stays focused on the figural regions and does not spill over to the adjacent background, as observed in the visual cortex. Our results indicate how progress in deep learning can be used to garner insight into the recurrent cortical processing for scene segmentation and object-based attention."

To address this challenge, we recorded the spiking activity of V1 neurons in monkeys viewing either natural scenes or scenes where the information in the RF was occluded, effectively removing the feedforward input. We found that V1 neurons responded rapidly and selectively to occluded scenes. V1 responses elicited by occluded stimuli could be used to decode individual scenes and could be predicted from those elicited by non-occluded images, indicating that there is an overlap between visually driven and contextual responses.

When subproblems are solved, relevant intermediate results need to be stored by neurons and propagated to the next subproblem, until the overarching goal has been completed. We will here consider visual tasks, which can be decomposed into sequences of elemental visual operations. Experimental evidence suggests that intermediate results of the elemental operations are stored in working memory as an enhancement of neural activity in the visual cortex. The focus of enhanced activity is then available for subsequent operations to act upon. The main question at stake is how the elemental operations and their sequencing can emerge in neural networks that are trained with only rewards, in a reinforcement learning setting.We here propose a new recurrent neural network architecture that can learn composite visual tasks that require the application of successive elemental operations. Specifically, we selected three tasks for which electrophysiological recordings of monkeys\u2019 visual cortex are available. To train the networks, we used RELEARNN, a biologically plausible four-factor Hebbian learning rule, which is local both in time and space. We report that networks learn elemental operations, such as contour grouping and visual search, and to execute sequences of operations, solely based on the characteristics of the visual stimuli and the reward structure of a task.After training was completed, the activity of the units of the neural network resembled the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of monkeys solving the same tasks \u2026"

This approach allows for investigation of information representation in different brain regions and time windows with greater spatial and temporal precision. Our results offer insights into the neural basis of visual perception, showing that V1 neurons represent texture and color, V4 neurons exhibit symmetric representations, and IT neurons reveal concept-like features.

This process through which learning can accelerate over time is referred to as learning-to-learn or meta-learning. While meta-learning can be implemented in recurrent neural networks, these networks tend to be trained with architectures that are not easily interpretable or mappable to the brain and with learning rules that are biologically implausible. Specifically, these rules employ backpropagation-through-time for learning, which relies on information that is unavailable at synapses that are undergoing plasticity in the brain. While memory models that exclusively use local information for their weight updates have been developed, they have limited capacity to integrate information over long timespans and therefore cannot easily learn-to-learn. Here, we propose a novel gated recurrent network named RECOLLECT, which can flexibly retain or forget information by means of a single memory gate and biologically plausible trial-and-error-learning that requires only local information. We demonstrate that RECOLLECT successfully learns to represent task-relevant information over increasingly long memory delays in a pro-/anti-saccade task, and that it learns to flush its memory at the end of a trial. Moreover, we show that RECOLLECT can learn-to-learn an effective policy on a reversal bandit task. Finally, we show that the solutions acquired by RECOLLECT resemble how animals learn similar tasks."
