There have been different proposals for the neuronal mechanisms that can mediate binding. One hypothesis is that binding is achieved by oscillations that synchronize neurons representing features of the same perceptual object. This view allows separate communication channels between different brain areas. Another hypothesis is that binding of features that are represented in different brain regions occurs when the neurons in these areas that respond to the same object simultaneously enhance their firing rate, which would correspond to directing object-based attention to these features. This review summarizes evidence in favor of and against these two hypotheses, examining the neuronal correlates of binding and assessing \u2026"

Using viral tracing we found that V1 ChCs predominantly receive monosynaptic input from local layer 5 pyramidal cells and higher-order cortical regions. Two-photon calcium imaging and convolutional neural network modelling revealed that ChCs are visually responsive but weakly selective for stimulus content. In mice running in a virtual tunnel, ChCs respond strongly to locomotion and halting visual flow, suggesting arousal-related activity. Visuomotor experience in the tunnel diminished visual responses of ChCs and induced structural plasticity of ChC boutons and axon initial segment length. Finally, ChCs only weakly inhibited pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that ChCs provide an arousal-related signal to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells that may modulate their activity and/or gate plasticity of their axon initial segments during behaviorally relevant events."

So far, the focus has been on how ANNs can help to explain the tuning of neurons at various stages of the visual cortical hierarchy. However, the role of modulatory feedback connections, which play a role in attention and perceptual organization, has not been tested yet. Here, we present a biologically plausible neural network that performs scene segmentation and can shift attention using modulatory feedback connections from higher to lower brain areas. The model replicates several neurophysiological signatures of recurrent processing. Specifically, figural regions elicit more neuronal activity in model units than the background. The modulation of neuronal activity by figure and ground occurs at a delay after the first feedforward response, because it depends on a loop through the higher model areas. Importantly, the enhancement of the figural response is controlled by object-based attention, which stays focused on the figural regions and does not spill over to the adjacent background, as observed in the visual cortex. Our results indicate how progress in deep learning can be used to garner insight into the recurrent cortical processing for scene segmentation and object-based attention."

To address this challenge, we recorded the spiking activity of V1 neurons in monkeys viewing either natural scenes or scenes where the information in the RF was occluded, effectively removing the feedforward input. We found that V1 neurons responded rapidly and selectively to occluded scenes. V1 responses elicited by occluded stimuli could be used to decode individual scenes and could be predicted from those elicited by non-occluded images, indicating that there is an overlap between visually driven and contextual responses.

When subproblems are solved, relevant intermediate results need to be stored by neurons and propagated to the next subproblem, until the overarching goal has been completed. We will here consider visual tasks, which can be decomposed into sequences of elemental visual operations. Experimental evidence suggests that intermediate results of the elemental operations are stored in working memory as an enhancement of neural activity in the visual cortex. The focus of enhanced activity is then available for subsequent operations to act upon. The main question at stake is how the elemental operations and their sequencing can emerge in neural networks that are trained with only rewards, in a reinforcement learning setting.We here propose a new recurrent neural network architecture that can learn composite visual tasks that require the application of successive elemental operations. Specifically, we selected three tasks for which electrophysiological recordings of monkeys\u2019 visual cortex are available. To train the networks, we used RELEARNN, a biologically plausible four-factor Hebbian learning rule, which is local both in time and space. We report that networks learn elemental operations, such as contour grouping and visual search, and to execute sequences of operations, solely based on the characteristics of the visual stimuli and the reward structure of a task.After training was completed, the activity of the units of the neural network resembled the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of monkeys solving the same tasks \u2026"

This process through which learning can accelerate over time is referred to as learning-to-learn or meta-learning. While meta-learning can be implemented in recurrent neural networks, these networks tend to be trained with architectures that are not easily interpretable or mappable to the brain and with learning rules that are biologically implausible. Specifically, these rules employ backpropagation-through-time for learning, which relies on information that is unavailable at synapses that are undergoing plasticity in the brain. While memory models that exclusively use local information for their weight updates have been developed, they have limited capacity to integrate information over long timespans and therefore cannot easily learn-to-learn. Here, we propose a novel gated recurrent network named RECOLLECT, which can flexibly retain or forget information by means of a single memory gate and biologically plausible trial-and-error-learning that requires only local information. We demonstrate that RECOLLECT successfully learns to represent task-relevant information over increasingly long memory delays in a pro-/anti-saccade task, and that it learns to flush its memory at the end of a trial. Moreover, we show that RECOLLECT can learn-to-learn an effective policy on a reversal bandit task. Finally, we show that the solutions acquired by RECOLLECT resemble how animals learn similar tasks."

To this end, we analyzed the relationship between multi-unit activity of macaque visual cortex and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (i.e., w-latents of StyleGAN) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled representations explain increasingly more variance than the alternative representations over the ventral stream. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding."

            "abstract": "Blindness affects 40 million people worldwide, and a neuroprosthesis may restore functional vision in the future. We developed a 1024-channel, chronically implantable prosthesis for the monkey visual cortex, using electrical stimulation to elicit percepts of dots of light (\u2018phosphenes\u2019) across hundreds of electrodes. Phosphene locations matched the receptive fields of stimulated neurons, and V4 activity predicted phosphene detection during stimulation in V1. Lastly, we stimulated multiple electrodes simultaneously to generate percepts composed of multiple phosphenes. The monkeys could immediately recognize simple phosphene shapes, directions of motion, and letters, demonstrating the potential of electrical stimulation to restore life-enhancing vision in the blind."
