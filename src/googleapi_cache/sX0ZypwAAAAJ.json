We describe work in building a visual stimulation system that receives camera input images and produces stimulation patterns for driving a large set of electrodes. The system consists of a convolutional neural network FPGA accelerator and a recording and stimulation Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that produces the stimulation patterns. It is aimed at restoring visual perception in visually impaired subjects. The FPGA accelerator, VPDNN, runs a visual prosthesis network that generates an output used to create stimulation patterns, which are then converted by the ASIC into current pulses to drive a multi-electrode array. The accelerator exploits spatial sparsity and the use of reduced bit precision parameters for reduced computation, memory and power for portability. Experimental results from the VPDNN show that the 94.5K parameter 14-layer CNN receiving an input of 128 \u00d7 128 has an inference frame rate of 83 frames per sec (FPS) and uses only an incremental power of 0.1 W, which is at least 10\u00d7 lower than that measured from a Jetson Nano. The ASIC adds a maximum delay of 2ms, however it does not impact the FPS thanks to double-buffered memory.

Our encoding analysis revealed that the -latent representations of feature-disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most effective candidate for predicting neural responses to images. Importantly, the usage of synthesized yet photorealistic images allowed for superior control over these data as their underlying latent representations were known a priori rather than approximated post-hoc. As such, we leveraged this property in neural reconstruction of the perceived images. Taken together with the fact that the (unsupervised) generative models themselves were never optimized on neural data, these results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement and unsupervised training as driving factors in shaping neural representations."

Instead, we take inspiration from the philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core of a scientific research programme is often not directly falsifiable but should be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights.

Classical control theory is pushed to its limit when aiming to design control laws that are suitable for large-scale, complex neural systems. This work proposes a scalable, data-driven, unified approach to study brain-machine-environment interaction using established tools from dynamical systems, optimal control theory, and deep learning. To unify the methodology, we define the environment, neural system, and prosthesis in terms of differential equations with learnable parameters, which effectively reduce to recurrent neural networks in the discrete-time case. Drawing on tools from optimal control, we describe three ways to train the system: Direct optimization of an objective function, oracle-based learning, and reinforcement learning. These approaches are adapted to different assumptions about knowledge of system equations, linearity, differentiability, and observability. We apply the proposed framework to train an in-silico neural system to perform tasks in a linear and a nonlinear environment, namely particle stabilization and pole balancing. After training, this model is perturbed to simulate impairment of sensor and motor function. We show how a prosthetic controller can be trained to restore the behavior of the neural system under increasing levels of perturbation. We expect that the proposed framework will enable rapid and flexible synthesis of control algorithms for neural prostheses that reduce the need for in-vivo testing.

However, it is unlikely that BP is implemented in its usual form within biological neural networks, because of its reliance on non-local information in propagating error gradients. Since biological neural networks are capable of highly efficient learning and responses from BP trained models can be related to neural responses, it seems reasonable that a biologically viable approximation of BP underlies synaptic plasticity in the brain. Gradient-adjusted incremental target propagation (GAIT-prop or GP for short) has recently been derived directly from BP and has been shown to successfully train networks in a more biologically plausible manner. However, so far, GP has only been shown to work on relatively low-dimensional problems, such as handwritten-digit recognition. This work addresses some of the scaling issues in GP and shows it to perform effective multi-layer credit assignment in deeper networks and on the much more challenging ImageNet dataset."

However, BP relies on two computationally distinct phases, does not provide a satisfactory explanation of biological learning, and can be challenging to apply for training of networks with discontinuities or noisy node dynamics. By comparison, node perturbation (NP) proposes learning by the injection of noise into the network activations, and subsequent measurement of the induced loss change. NP relies on two forward (inference) passes, does not make use of network derivatives, and has been proposed as a model for learning in biological systems. However, standard NP is highly data inefficient and unstable due to its unguided, noise-based, activity search. In this work, we investigate different formulations of NP and relate it to the concept of directional derivatives as well as combining it with a decorrelating mechanism for layer-wise inputs. We find that a closer alignment with directional derivatives, and induction of decorrelation of inputs at every layer significantly enhances performance of NP learning making it competitive with BP."

These advantages enable ANNs to engage the entire spectrum of the evidence. Failures of particular models drive progress in a vibrant ANN research program of human vision."

In this study, we apply the brain2pix reconstruction model to multi-unit activity (MUA) data from the macaque brain, providing a novel extension of the model. This approach allows for investigation of information representation in different brain regions and time windows with greater spatial and temporal precision. Our results offer insights into the neural basis of visual perception, showing that V1 neurons represent texture and color, V4 neurons exhibit symmetric representations, and IT neurons reveal concept-like features. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to decode features at different layers of a neural network, with V1 more strongly correlated with initial layers and V4 and IT with deeper layers. Overall, our approach provides a valuable tool for studying brain representations in high temporal and spatial detail."

            "abstract": "The enabling technology of visual prosthetics for the blind is making rapid progress. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the functional outcomes, which can depend on many design choices in the development. In visual prostheses with a head-mounted camera, a particularly challenging question is how to deal with the gaze-locked visual percept associated with spatial updating conflicts in the brain. A recently proposed compensation strategy is gaze-contingent image processing with eye-tracking, which enables natural visual scanning and reestablished spatial updating based on eye movements. The current study evaluates the benefits of gaze-contingent processing versus gaze-locked and gaze-ignored simulations in the context of mobility and orientation, using a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with sighted subjects. Compared to gaze-locked vision, gaze-contingent processing was found to improve the speed in all experimental tasks, as well as the subjective quality of vision. Similar or further improvements were found in a control condition that ignores gaze-depended effects, a simulation that is unattainable in the clinical reality. Our results suggest that gaze-locked vision and spatial updating conflicts can be debilitating for complex visually-guided activities of daily living such as mobility and orientation. Therefore, for prospective users of head-steered prostheses with an unimpaired oculomotor system, the inclusion of a compensatory eye-tracking system is strongly endorsed."

Recent developments in deep learning have enabled progress in object detection and tracking, but rodent behavior recognition struggles to exceed 75\u201380% accuracy for ethologically relevant behaviors. We investigate the main reasons why and distinguish three aspects of behavior dynamics that are difficult to automate. We isolate these aspects in an artificial dataset and reproduce effects with the state-of-the-art behavior recognition models. Having an endless amount of labeled training data with minimal input noise and representative dynamics will enable research to optimize behavior recognition architectures and get closer to human-like recognition performance for behaviors with challenging dynamics."

To this end, we analyzed the relationship between multi-unit activity of macaque visual cortex and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (i.e., w-latents of StyleGAN) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled representations explain increasingly more variance than the alternative representations over the ventral stream. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding."
