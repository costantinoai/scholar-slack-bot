With the digitization of artworks in recent years, thousands of images of a particular scene or narrative could potentially be linked together. However, manually linking this data with consistent objectiveness can be a highly challenging and time-consuming task. In this work, we present a novel approach called Image Composition Canvas (ICC++) to compare and retrieve images having similar compositional elements. ICC++ is an improvement over ICC, specializing in generating low and high-level features (compositional elements) motivated by Max Imdahl\u2019s work. To this end, we present a rigorous quantitative and qualitative comparison of our approach with traditional and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods showing that our proposed method outperforms \u2026"
