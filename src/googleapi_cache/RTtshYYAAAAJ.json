            "abstract": "A long-standing engineering ambition has been to design anthropomorphic bionic limbs: devices that look like and are controlled in the same way as the biological body (biomimetic). The untested assumption is that biomimetic motor control enhances device embodiment, learning, generalization and automaticity. To test this, we compared biomimetic and non-biomimetic control strategies for non-disabled participants when learning to control a wearable myoelectric bionic hand operated by an eight-channel electromyography pattern-recognition system. We compared motor learning across days and behavioural tasks for two training groups: biomimetic (mimicking the desired bionic hand gesture with biological hand) and arbitrary control (mapping an unrelated biological hand gesture with the desired bionic gesture). For both trained groups, training improved bionic limb control, reduced cognitive reliance and \u2026"

            "abstract": "The amygdala is present in a diverse range of vertebrate species, such as lizards, rodents, and primates; however, its structure and connectivity differs across species. The increased connections to visual sensory areas in primate species suggests that understanding the visual selectivity of the amygdala in detail is critical to revealing the principles underlying its function in primate cognition. Therefore, we designed a high-resolution, contrast-agent enhanced, event-related fMRI experiment, and scanned 3 adult rhesus macaques, while they viewed 96 naturalistic stimuli. Half of these stimuli were social (defined by the presence of a conspecific), the other half were nonsocial. We also nested manipulations of emotional valence (positive, neutral, and negative) and visual category (faces, nonfaces, animate, and inanimate) within the stimulus set. The results reveal widespread effects of emotional valence, with the \u2026"

By grounding physiological responses and behavior in neuroanatomy, the framework provided a critical guide for understanding vision. Although the framework has evolved over time, as our understanding of the physiology and neuroanatomy expanded, cortical visual processing is still often conceptualized as two separate pathways emerging from the primary visual cortex that support distinct behaviors (\u201cwhat\u201d vs. \u201cwhere/how\u201d). Here, we take a historical perspective and review the continuing evolution of the framework, discussing key and often overlooked insights. Rather than a functional and neuroanatomical bifurcation into two independent serial, hierarchical pathways, the current evidence points to two highly recurrent heterarchies with heterogeneous \u2026"

            "abstract": "In their comprehensive review, Spagna and colleagues synthesize work on mental imagery across many domains and propose a novel, heterarchical model of imagery (HeXaGeN)[1]. In this model, frontoparietal networks initiate and maintain mental imagery while domain-preferring regions in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) are activated during imagery only in response to their preferred stimuli. Key to their model is the posit of a fusiform imagery node (FIN) in left fusiform gyrus that acts as a domain-general hub between frontal areas and domain-preferring regions in VTC.A virtue of Spagna and colleagues\u2019 review is their highlighting of the diverse paradigms that have been used to study mental imagery across domains. This survey of paradigms makes plain that the tasks used to study imagery are highly heterogeneous and overlap with tasks associated with other processes such as working memory. For instance, studies on imagery involve instructions from simply visualizing a non-present item to synthesizing two presented items mentally or judging the difference between two recalled items [2\u20134]. How should we think about the relationship between such a variety of tasks and the underlying cognitive process or processes they reflect? Prior research has often taken for granted that concepts imported from cognitive psychology reflect unique, separable processes and then designed tasks intended to isolate those processes. Yet, the lack of systematicity in task usage for imagery studies highlights the importance of focusing on the specific task demands created by the paradigms employed [5]. For instance, the HeXaGeN model treats working \u2026"

The dominant interpretation of these effects is that they reflect activation of distinct \u201ccategory-selective\u201d brain regions specialized to represent these and other stimulus categories. We sought to explore an alternative perspective: that the response to these stimuli is determined less by whether they form distinct categories, and more by their relevance to different forms of natural behavior. In this regard, food is an interesting test case, since it is primarily distinguished from other objects by its edibility, not its appearance, and there is evidence of food-selectivity in human visual cortex. Food is also associated with a common behavior, eating, and food consumption typically also involves the manipulation of food, often with the hands. In this context, food items share many \u2026"
