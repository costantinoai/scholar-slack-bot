While there is mounting evidence for the shared cognitive and neural representation space between visual and tactile shape, previous research tended to rely on dissimilarity structures between objects and had not examined the detailed properties of shape representation in the absence of vision. To address this gap, we conducted three explicit object shape knowledge production experiments with congenitally blind and sighted participants, who were asked to produce verbal features, 3D clay models, and 2D drawings of familiar objects with varying levels of tactile exposure, including tools, large nonmanipulable objects, and animals. We found that the absence of visual experience (i.e., in the blind group) led to stronger differences in animals than in tools and large objects, suggesting that direct tactile \u2026"

Here, we investigate controlled and automatic evaluations of robots based on brain responses during viewing of suprathreshold (duration: 200 ms) and subthreshold (duration: 17 ms) humanoid robot stimuli. Our behavioral analysis revealed that despite participants\u2019 self-reported positive attitudes, they held negative implicit attitudes toward humanoid robots.

            "abstract": "Research on brain plasticity, particularly in the context of deafness, consistently emphasizes the reorganization of the auditory cortex. However, a critical question arises: to what extent do all individuals with deafness show the same level of reorganization? To address this question, we examined the individual differences in deafness functional connectivity (FC), specifically from the deprived auditory cortex. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable differentiation between individuals deriving from the absence of shared auditory experiences, resulting in heightened FC variability among deaf individuals, compared to more consistent FC in the hearing group. Notably, this increased variability is particularly pronounced in regions where FC diverges between the deaf and hearing individuals, reflecting the individual differences in how the brain reorganizes in response to sensory deprivation. Additionally, connectivity to language regions also becomes more diverse in deafness across individuals. Importantly, this does not stem from delayed language acquisition, as it is found in deaf native signers, who are exposed to rich natural language since birth. Further, comparing FC diversity between deaf native signers and deaf delayed signers who were deprived of language in early development, we show that language experience also impacts individual differences, although to a more moderate extent. Overall, our research points out the intricate interplay between brain plasticity and individual differences, shedding light on the diverse ways reorganization manifests among individuals. It further joins findings in blindness, showing that individual differences are \u2026"

Tulving\u2019s perspective resulted in a paradigm shift in the study of human conceptual knowledge. Semantic research has since evolved as a multidisciplinary endeavor advanced by fields with their own entrenched theoretical perspectives and idiosyncratic lexicons (eg, concept has different meanings in philosophy vs. cognitive psychology). Yet, no uniform nomenclature exists for translating results and aligning theories across disparate fields. Core semantic constructs remain underspecified to an extent that falsifiability and incremental theory-building remain elusive. One consequence of these limitations is that similar arguments about semantic phenomena are continually recycled without resolution. The aim of this multidisciplinary workgroup (N= 53) was to establish consensus definitions for some of the major recurring constructs in semantic research (eg, concept, amodal, abstract). These efforts yielded a glossary consisting of succinct definitions, agreement, subjective confidence ratings, relevant theoretical background, and principled dissenting views. These core definitions will potentially yield benchmarks for aligning perspectives and improving cross-disciplinary communication in semantic research."

            "abstract": "One signature of the human brain is its ability to derive knowledge from language inputs, in addition to nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch. How does human language experience modulate the mechanism by which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? We investigated this question using a unique human model with varying amounts and qualities of early language exposure: early deaf adults who were born to hearing parents and had reduced early exposure and delayed acquisition of any natural human language (speech or sign), with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as the control group that matches on nonlinguistic sensory experiences. Neural responses in a semantic judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI. The deaf group with reduced early language exposure, compared with the deaf control group, showed reduced semantic sensitivity, in both multivariate pattern (semantic structure encoding) and univariate (abstractness effect) analyses, in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results provide positive, causal evidence that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dATL, highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences."

We propose a common cognitive component underlying both effects--social-semantic working memory. We confirmed two key predictions of our hypothesis using fMRI: First, the left vTPJ and lATL showed sensitivity to sentences only when the sentences conveyed social meaning.; second, these regions showed persistent social-semantic-selective activity after the linguistic stimuli disappeared. We additionally found that both regions were sensitive to the socialness of nonlinguistic stimuli and were more tightly connected with the social-semantic-processing areas than with the sentence-processing areas. The converging evidence indicates the social-semantic-working-memory function of the left vTPJ and lATL and challenges the general-semantic and/or syntactic accounts for the neural activity of these regions."

            "abstract": "The functional connectome of the human brain represents the fundamental network architecture of neural activity, but its normative growth trajectory over the life course remains unknown. Here, we aggregate the largest, quality-controlled multimodal neuroimaging dataset across 119 global sites, including 33,809 task-free fMRI and structural MRI scans of 32,328 individuals aged from 32 postmenstrual weeks to 80 years old. The lifespan growth charts of the connectome are quantified at the whole cortex, system, and regional levels using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape. We find critical inflection points in the nonlinear growth trajectories of the whole-brain functional connectome, notably peaking in the fourth decade of life. After establishing the first fine-grained, lifespan-spanning suite of system-level brain atlases, we generate person-specific parcellation maps and further elucidate distinct timelines of maturation for functional segregation within various subsystems. We identify a spatiotemporal gradient axis that governs the life-course growth of regional connectivity, transitioning from primary sensory cortices to higher-order association regions. Using the connectome-based normative model, we demonstrate substantial individual heterogeneities at the network level in patients with autism spectrum disorder and patients with major depressive disorder, respectively. Our findings shed light on the functional connectome's life-course evolution, serving as normative references for understanding network growth principles of the human brain and assessing individual variations of patients with neuropsychiatric conditions."

Although there is evidence for multisensory effects on its activity, these are typically found for the processing of simple sounds and their properties, for example spatially or temporally-congruent simple sounds. However, in congenitally blind individuals, V1 is involved in language processing, with no evidence of major changes in anatomical connectivity that could explain this seemingly drastic functional change. This is at odds with current accounts of neural plasticity, which emphasize the role of connectivity and conserved function in determining a neural tissue\u2019s role even after atypical early experiences. To reconcile what appears to be unprecedented functional reorganization with known accounts of plasticity limitations, we tested whether V1\u2019s multisensory roles include responses to spoken language in sighted individuals. Using fMRI, we found that V1 in normally sighted individuals was indeed activated by comprehensible spoken sentences as compared to an incomprehensible reversed speech control condition, and more strongly so in the left compared to the right hemisphere. Activation in V1 for language was also significant and comparable for abstract and concrete words, suggesting it was not driven by visual imagery. Last, this activation did not stem from increased attention to the auditory onset of words, nor was it correlated with attentional arousal ratings, making general attention accounts an unlikely explanation. Together these findings suggest that V1 responds to spoken language even in sighted individuals \u2026"

The human cultural evolution framework assumes that these stress variables have broadly shaped human psychology. However, how it affects conceptual processing, a basic cognitive component, is largely unknown. Using historical data from the past century in the US, UK, Italy, and China, the research found that pathogen severity variation across time was associated with significant changes in the collective semantic space, as reflected in language, in significantly similar ways across the countries with varying sociocultural properties. In all four countries, increasing pathogen severity was associated with increased use of words about sensory-motor properties, tight social relations and traditional values, robust against alternative stress variables, such as war, natural disaster or general economic growth. These results highlight the universal dynamic mechanisms of collective semantics, such that pathogens stresses potentially drive sensorial, tight/traditional-value oriented semantic processing."

In congenital deafness, sensory-deprived cortex can be recruited to represent sensory information belonging to other modalities, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. Previous studies have indicated that the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf, but not of hearing individuals, is recruited during visual tasks. However, it is not clear to what extent, and how, these cross-modal responses in the deprived auditory cortex represent low-level visual spatial information or map the visual field. Here, we addressed this question directly in an fMRI case-study, aiming to map retinotopic features in the auditory cortex. Two congenitally deaf and one hearing participant went through a conventional retinotopy fMRI experiment with visual stimuli designed to map the visual system. Using population receptive field (pRF) modelling, we revealed retinotopic-related responses in the auditory cortex of the deaf, but not in the hearing. These responses, that were mostly lateralized to the right hemisphere, represented the contralateral visual field, and were characterized by large receptive fields, centred to near foveal areas. Interestingly, we found that these responses to visual stimuli predominantly reflected negative BOLD signals in the auditory cortex of the deaf, suggesting that visual information might be represented through cross-modal deactivation signals."
