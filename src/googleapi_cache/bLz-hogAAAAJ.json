How does human language experience modulate the mechanism by which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? We investigated this question using a unique human model with varying amounts and qualities of early language exposure: early deaf adults who were born to hearing parents and had reduced early exposure and delayed acquisition of any natural human language (speech or sign), with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as the control group that matches on nonlinguistic sensory experiences. Neural responses in a semantic judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI. The deaf group with reduced early language exposure, compared with the deaf control group, showed reduced semantic sensitivity, in both multivariate pattern (semantic structure encoding) and univariate (abstractness effect) analyses, in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results provide positive, causal evidence that language experience drives the neural semantic representation in the dATL, highlighting the roles of language in forming human neural semantic structures beyond nonverbal sensory experiences."

We propose a common cognitive component underlying both effects--social-semantic working memory. We confirmed two key predictions of our hypothesis using fMRI: First, the left vTPJ and lATL showed sensitivity to sentences only when the sentences conveyed social meaning.; second, these regions showed persistent social-semantic-selective activity after the linguistic stimuli disappeared. We additionally found that both regions were sensitive to the socialness of nonlinguistic stimuli and were more tightly connected with the social-semantic-processing areas than with the sentence-processing areas. The converging evidence indicates the social-semantic-working-memory function of the left vTPJ and lATL and challenges the general-semantic and/or syntactic accounts for the neural activity of these regions."

Three learning methods are employed, each resulting in some degree of learning within a 12-min learning session. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results reveal that, when listening to the same story, the classic temporal-frontal language network is significantly enhanced by learning.

Here, we aggregate the largest, quality-controlled multimodal neuroimaging dataset across 119 global sites, including 33,809 task-free fMRI and structural MRI scans of 32,328 individuals aged from 32 postmenstrual weeks to 80 years old. The lifespan growth charts of the connectome are quantified at the whole cortex, system, and regional levels using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape. We find critical inflection points in the nonlinear growth trajectories of the whole-brain functional connectome, notably peaking in the fourth decade of life. After establishing the first fine-grained, lifespan-spanning suite of system-level brain atlases, we generate person-specific parcellation maps and further elucidate distinct timelines of maturation for functional segregation within various subsystems. We identify a spatiotemporal gradient axis that governs the life-course growth of regional connectivity, transitioning from primary sensory cortices to higher-order association regions. Using the connectome-based normative model, we demonstrate substantial individual heterogeneities at the network level in patients with autism spectrum disorder and patients with major depressive disorder, respectively. Our findings shed light on the functional connectome's life-course evolution, serving as normative references for understanding network growth principles of the human brain and assessing individual variations of patients with neuropsychiatric conditions."

Although there is evidence for multisensory effects on its activity, these are typically found for the processing of simple sounds and their properties, for example spatially or temporally-congruent simple sounds. However, in congenitally blind individuals, V1 is involved in language processing, with no evidence of major changes in anatomical connectivity that could explain this seemingly drastic functional change. This is at odds with current accounts of neural plasticity, which emphasize the role of connectivity and conserved function in determining a neural tissue\u2019s role even after atypical early experiences. To reconcile what appears to be unprecedented functional reorganization with known accounts of plasticity limitations, we tested whether V1\u2019s multisensory roles include responses to spoken language in sighted individuals. Using fMRI, we found that V1 in normally sighted individuals was indeed activated by comprehensible spoken sentences as compared to an incomprehensible reversed speech control condition, and more strongly so in the left compared to the right hemisphere. Activation in V1 for language was also significant and comparable for abstract and concrete words, suggesting it was not driven by visual imagery. Last, this activation did not stem from increased attention to the auditory onset of words, nor was it correlated with attentional arousal ratings, making general attention accounts an unlikely explanation. Together these findings suggest that V1 responds to spoken language even in sighted individuals \u2026"

Using a combination of region-of-interest-based support vector machine decoding analysis and voxel selection method, we found that the top visual-discriminative voxels in the left occipital cortex (OC) could also classify haptic shape features, and the top haptic-discriminative voxels in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) could also classify visual shape features.

The human cultural evolution framework assumes that these stress variables have broadly shaped human psychology. However, how it affects conceptual processing, a basic cognitive component, is largely unknown. Using historical data from the past century in the US, UK, Italy, and China, the research found that pathogen severity variation across time was associated with significant changes in the collective semantic space, as reflected in language, in significantly similar ways across the countries with varying sociocultural properties. In all four countries, increasing pathogen severity was associated with increased use of words about sensory-motor properties, tight social relations and traditional values, robust against alternative stress variables, such as war, natural disaster or general economic growth. These results highlight the universal dynamic mechanisms of collective semantics, such that pathogens stresses potentially drive sensorial, tight/traditional-value oriented semantic processing."

            "abstract": "Neuroplasticity is the ability of the human brain to reorganize and modify its activity throughout life. In congenital deafness, sensory-deprived cortex can be recruited to represent sensory information belonging to other modalities, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. Previous studies have indicated that the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf, but not of hearing individuals, is recruited during visual tasks. However, it is not clear to what extent, and how, these cross-modal responses in the deprived auditory cortex represent low-level visual spatial information or map the visual field. Here, we addressed this question directly in an fMRI case-study, aiming to map retinotopic features in the auditory cortex. Two congenitally deaf and one hearing participant went through a conventional retinotopy fMRI experiment with visual stimuli designed to map the visual system. Using population receptive field (pRF) modelling, we revealed retinotopic-related responses in the auditory cortex of the deaf, but not in the hearing. These responses, that were mostly lateralized to the right hemisphere, represented the contralateral visual field, and were characterized by large receptive fields, centred to near foveal areas. Interestingly, we found that these responses to visual stimuli predominantly reflected negative BOLD signals in the auditory cortex of the deaf, suggesting that visual information might be represented through cross-modal deactivation signals."
