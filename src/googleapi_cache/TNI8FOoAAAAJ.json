In their insightful review, Molinaro & Collins (2023) redefine the conventional role of goals in computational theories of learning and decision-making, arguing that in reinforcement learning frameworks, traditionally \u2018fixed\u2019elements (eg, states, actions, and rewards) are in fact intricately linked to and influenced by an agent\u2019s current goals. In support of their claim that goals are dynamic elements that actively shape information processing altering an agent\u2019s state, they draw on fMRI work showing that neural representations in prefrontal cortex vary systematically when participants imagine using the same object to achieve different goals (Castegnetti et al., 2021). These and other findings suggest that goals do not only influence high-level cognitive processes, but can also modulate the encoding of sensory information, including representations in early sensory areas (Schaffner et al., 2023). Here we provide nuance to this perspective by"

            "abstract": "Understanding the neural basis of human object recognition and semantic knowledge has been a significant area of exploration, with recent focus aiming to reveal the developmental trajectory of this core brain function. At present, however, there is limited access to high-quality neuroimaging data obtained from human infants. Addressing this gap, we present a dataset comprising electroencephalography responses from 42 human infants obtained in response to visual presentations of various objects. Leveraging a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, 42 infants between 2 and 12 months of age viewed 200 images spanning 50 distinct objects, with as many repetitions as possible tailored to individual infants comfort. Our technical validation demonstrates discernible neural responses to both individual objects and categorical distinctions, affirming the dataset's robustness and utility for exploring the neural underpinnings of visual object recognition in infancy. Building upon insights gained from adult studies, our findings suggest that fast presentation paradigms hold promise for efficiently capturing electrophysiological responses to a large array of visual stimuli in human infants. This dataset represents a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of the developmental trajectory of object recognition and semantic knowledge in the early stages of human life."

Characterising how visual information is represented in each hemisphere over time is crucial for understanding how hemispheric transfer contributes to perception. Here, we investigated information processing within each hemisphere over time and the degree to which it is distinct or duplicated across hemispheres. We presented participants with object images lateralised to the left or right visual fields while measuring their brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG). Stimulus coding was more robust and emerged earlier in the contralateral than the ipsilateral hemisphere. Presentation of two stimuli, one to each hemifield, reduced the fidelity of representations in both hemispheres relative to one stimulus alone, signifying hemispheric interference. Finally, we found that processing within the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemisphere was biased to image-related over concept-related information. Together, these results suggest that hemispheric transfer operates to filter irrelevant information and efficiently prioritise processing of meaning."

We measured neural responses using electroencephalography (N = 16) to 256 grating stimuli that varied in orientation, spatial frequency, contrast, and colour. We then mapped the response profiles of the neural coding of each visual feature and their interactions, and related these to independently obtained behavioural judgements of stimulus similarity. The results confirmed fundamental principles of feature coding in the visual system, such that all four features were processed simultaneously but differed in their dynamics, and there was distinctive conjunction coding for different combinations of features in the neural responses. Importantly, modelling of the behaviour revealed that every stimulus feature contributed to perceptual judgements, despite the untargeted nature of the behavioural task. Further, the relationship between neural coding and behaviour was evident from initial processing stages, signifying that the fundamental features, not just their interactions, contribute to perception.

In the current study, 821 participants viewed streams containing seven landscape images that were presented at either a self-paced (active) or an automatic (passive) rate. Critically, the presentation speed in each automatic trial was matched to the speed of a self-paced trial for each participant. Both memory accuracy and memory confidence were greater on self-paced compared to automatic trials. These results indicate that active, self-paced progression \u2026"

Participants were presented with pairs of artworks, one human-made and one AI-generated, in either a preference task or a discrimination task. Results revealed a significant preference for AI-generated artworks. At the same time, a separate group of participants were above-chance at detecting the AI-generated work within each pair, indicating a perceptible distinction between human and artificial creative works. This shift in art preference to favour synthetic creations is poised to revolutionise the way we think about art and its value to human society, prompting reflections on authorship, authenticity, and human creativity in the era of generative AI."

The attentional blink has been well studied in experimental lab settings. However, despite the rise of online methods for behavioural research, their suitability for studying the attentional blink has not been fully addressed yet, the main concern being the lack of control and timing variability for stimulus presentation. Here, we investigated the suitability of online testing for studying the attentional blink with visual objects. Our results show a clear attentional blink effect between 200 to 400ms following the distractor including a Lag 1 sparing effect in line with previous research despite significant inter-subject and timing variability. This work demonstrates the suitability of online methods for studying the attentional blink with visual objects, opening new avenues to explore its underlying processes."

Applied to neuroimaging data, MVPA decoding for inference uses above chance decoding to identify statistically reliable condition-specific information in neuroimaging data which may be missed by univariate methods. However, several analysis choices influence decoding success, and the combined effects of these choices have not been fully evaluated. We systematically assessed the influence of trial averaging and resampling on decoding accuracy and subsequent statistical outcome on simulated data. Although the optimal parameters varied with the classifier and cross-validation approach used, we found that modest trial averaging using 5-10% of the total number of trials per condition improved accuracy and associated t-statistics. In addition, a resampling value of 2 could improve t-statistics and classification performance, but was not always necessary.

This study investigates the minimum number of repetitions required for reliable decoding accuracies in RSVP decoding paradigms. We used previously published EEG data and conducted a standard decoding analysis while varying the number of repetitions used. We found that it is possible to obtain reliable decoding accuracies with only around six repetitions of each condition, which has important implications for research questions that require short experiments, particularly for studying populations who may not be able to tolerate longer or more demanding protocols. These findings highlight the potential benefits of using efficient RSVP decoding designs and conducting short experiments and may have far-reaching impacts in cognitive neuroscience, by providing insights into optimizing data collection methods for diverse populations and experimental protocols."

We measured neural responses using electroencephalography (N=16) to 256 grating stimuli that varied in orientation, spatial frequency, contrast, and colour. We then mapped the response profiles of the neural coding of each visual feature and their interactions, and related these to independently obtained behavioural judgements of stimulus similarity. The results confirmed fundamental principles of feature coding in the visual system, such that all four features were processed simultaneously but differed in their dynamics, and there was distinctive conjunction coding for different combinations of features in the neural responses. Importantly, modelling of the behaviour revealed that every feature contributed to perceptual experience, despite the untargeted nature of the behavioural task. Further, the relationship between neural coding and behaviour was evident from initial processing stages, signifying that the fundamental features, not just their interactions, are crucial for perceptual experience. This study highlights the importance of understanding how feature coding progresses through the visual hierarchy and the \u2026"

            "abstract": "Transforming sensory inputs into meaningful neural representations is critical to adaptive behaviour in everyday environments. While non-invasive neuroimaging methods are the de-facto method for investigating neural representations, they remain expensive, not widely available, time-consuming, and restrictive in terms of the experimental conditions and participant populations they can be used with. Here we show that movement trajectories collected in online behavioural experiments can be used to measure the emergence and dynamics of neural representations with fine temporal resolution. By combining online computer mouse-tracking and publicly available neuroimaging (MEG and fMRI) data via Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we show that movement trajectories track the evolution of visual representations over time. We used a time constrained face/object categorization task on a previously published set of images containing human faces, illusory faces and objects to demonstrate that time-resolved representational structures derived from movement trajectories correlate with those derived from MEG, revealing the unfolding of category representations in comparable temporal detail (albeit delayed) to MEG. Furthermore, we show that movement-derived representational structures correlate with those derived from fMRI in most task-relevant brain areas, faces and objects selective areas in this proof of concept. Our results highlight the richness of movement trajectories and the power of the RSA framework to reveal and compare their information content, opening new avenues to better understand human perception."
