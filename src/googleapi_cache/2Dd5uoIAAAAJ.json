In a previous intervention testing the software with 1st graders, fluency and comprehension were boosted, but only when used in concert with reading instruction at the start of the year. Here, we asked whether a similar intervention would be more efficient if it started a year earlier, in kindergarten. Forty classes (1092\u2009=\u2009children) were randomized into playing Kalulu Phonics or the matched Kalulu Numbers control game for the first half of the year, with reversed assignments in the second half. Ten non-randomized business-as-usual classes also participated. In a cross-over effect, children who used the phonics version improved in letter naming, grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC) matching and fluency. Students with the number version improved in \u2026"

To this age-old question, contemporary neuroscience gives a simple answer: we are exquisite neuronal machines. Each of our dreams, thoughts, and feelings arises from a pattern of activity in our brain. In Stanislas Dehaene\u2019s Seeing the Mind, we learn not only that the mind maps onto the brain, but that it is just a complex electrical motif on the tapestry of our neurons. In this richly illustrated and highly accessible book, Dehaene uses the power of brain images to tell the story of centuries-old efforts to understand who we are, and how it is possible that our thoughts emerge from just three pounds of flesh. Seeing the Mind is divided into one hundred topics, each described by a spectacular full-page color image and, on the facing page, a brief text that explains what this image means and why it matters. By weaving together images and text, the book brings readers into the intimacy of their own brains. As Dehaene explains,\u201cAll the gorgeous biological processes that you are about to discover are taking place, right now, inside your own brain.\u201d A modern cabinet of curiosities, Seeing the Mind is an intriguing and memorable read that will astonish readers with a direct, face-to-face meeting with themselves\u2014and with the material stuff of their thoughts and dreams."

Decoding of MEG signals revealed three processing stages. During phrase comprehension, the representation of individual words was sustained for a variable duration depending on phrasal context. During the delay period, the word code was replaced by a working-memory code whose activation increased with semantic complexity. Finally, the speed and accuracy of retrieval depended on semantic complexity and was faster for surface than for deep semantic properties. In conclusion, we propose that the brain \u2026"

To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word 'she', to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells' preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension. This study uniquely demonstrates, at the single-cell level, how memory and language are linked."

We first show a striking homology in spatial organization of networks between monkeys and humans, indicating cross-species similarities in resting-state fMRI structure. We then track how network organization shifts under different anesthesia conditions in macaque monkeys.

We describe the Malabi, a screener to identify deficits in various orthographic, lexical, and sublexical components of the reading process in French. The Malabi utilizes stimuli that are sensitive to different forms of dyslexia, including\" attentional dyslexia\", as it is traditionally refered to, characterized by letter-to-word binding impairments leading to letter migrations between words (eg,\" bar cat\" misread as\" bat car\"), and\" letter-position dyslexia\", resulting in letter transpositions within words (eg,\" destiny\" misread as\" density\"). After collecting reading error norms from 138 French middle-school students, we analyzed error types of 16 students with developmental dyslexia. We identified three selective cases of attentional dyslexia and one case of letter-position dyslexia. Further tests confirmed our diagnosis and demonstrate, for the first time, how these dyslexias are manifested in French. These results underscore the significance of recognizing and discussing the existence of multiple dyslexias, both in research contexts when selecting participants for dyslexia studies, and in practical settings where educators and practitioners work with students to develop personalized support. The test and supporting materials are available on Open Science Framework (https://osf. io/3pgzb/)."

Method: 1,501 French 6th graders passed a one-minute speeded reading-aloud task evaluating fluency, and a ten-minute computerized lexical decision task evaluating the impact of lexicality, length, word frequency and pseudoword type. Results: As predicted, the word length effect varied dramatically with reading fluency, with the least fluent students showing a length effect even for frequent words.

            "abstract": "Learning to read places a strong challenge on the visual system. Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate highly similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of sizes and absolute positions. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by training deep neural network models to recognize written words and then analyzing how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across different layers of the network. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the \"visual word form area\" of the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their distance from the blank space at the left or right of a word, thus acting as \"space bigrams\". These units specifically encode ordinal positions and operate by pooling across low and high-frequency detector units from early layers of the network. The proposed neural code provides a mechanistic insight into how information on letter identity and position is extracted and allow for invariant word recognition, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading."

Here, we examined whether such skills for intuitive statistics are confined to humans or may also exist in non-human primates. We trained Guinea baboons (Papio papio) to associate arbitrary geometrical shapes with the increasing or decreasing trends of noiseless and noisy scatterplots, while varying the number of points, the noise level, and the regression slope. Many baboons successfully learned this conditional match-to-sample task for both noiseless and noisy plots. Crucially, for successful baboons, accuracy varied as a sigmoid function of the t-value of the regression, the same statistical index upon which humans also base their answers, even after controlling for other variables. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the human perception of data graphics is based on the pre-emption and recycling of a phylogenetically older competence of the primate visual system for extracting the principal axes of visual displays."

We argue that number-to-line tasks are a great probe, as children need to think about magnitude and have many opportunities for error. We tested 26,000 pupils from 6th to 10th grades and analyzed their errors. In 6th grade, 80% of the responses were wrong; 45% were still so in 10th grade. We observed seven error patterns. In particular, younger and lower-performing children mostly confused fractions with decimals; older and higher-performing children rather placed the inverse of the target fraction. All grades also confused the roles of the numerator and the denominator. We propose that children use two strategies: they either convert the target fraction into a decimal or partition the line into units to count. We discuss theoretical (strategy choice vs. strategy execution) and pedagogical (identify and remediate misunderstandings) implications."

Previous neuroimaging studies, primarily utilizing 3T scanners, have identified an extensive fronto-temporal network involved in forming linguistic structures and executing merge operations. Intracranial recordings in these areas reveal a more distributed picture, with adjacent regions undertaking diverse linguistic tasks. We designed a 7T fMRI visual task to investigate the neural coding of syntactic operations. In healthy French-speaking participants, we initially identified the language network using a localizer. Subsequently, we employed short 3-word stimuli, presented briefly (200ms), to explore the response profiles within the language network. These stimuli included control conditions, affirmative statements, and interrogative sentences, all matched for letter and character count. Preliminary results indicate that 200ms is sufficient to differentiate between sentences and non-sentences, and suggest a finely-tuned specialization for syntactic operations within language network subregions."

In contrast, non-human primates exhibit very limited proficiency in recognizing abstract representations. This research delves into this human singularity for visual abstraction, through neuroimaging experiments conducted in both humans and non-human primates. Stimuli presenting the same concept (e.g. a house or a face) but varying in abstraction levels (photos, drawings, symbols, and words) were initially presented to a monkey, while intracranial recording of his brain were obtained (16 Utah arrays distributed in V1, V4 and IT). Preliminary results indicate that monkey display early signs of abstraction, particularly for evolutionarily ancient categories such as faces. MEG and fMRI recordings of human subjects are also currently underway, striving to unveil the neuronal mechanisms that set our species apart in the domain of visual abstraction."

While many studies have focused on subsets of math concepts such as numbers, fractions, or geometric shapes, few have ventured beyond these elementary domains. Here, we attempted to map out the full space of math concepts and to answer two specific questions: can distributed semantic models, such a GloVe, provide a satisfactory fit to human semantic judgments in mathematics? And how does this fit vary with education? We first analyzed all of the French and English Wikipedia pages with math contents, and used a semi-automatic procedure to extract the 1,000 most frequent math terms in both languages. In a second step, we collected extensive behavioral judgments of familiarity and semantic similarity between them. About half of the variance in human similarity judgments was explained by vector embeddings that attempt to capture latent semantic structures based on cooccurence statistics. Participants' self-reported level of education modulated familiarity and similarity, allowing us to create a partial hierarchy among high-level math concepts. Our results converge onto the proposal of a map of math space, organized as a database of math terms with information about their frequency, familiarity, grade of acquisition, and entanglement with other concepts."

We formulate and test the hypothesis that, beyond an evolutionarily ancient ventral visual circuit for object recognition, the perception of geometry also relies on an additional system encoding discrete regularities such as symmetries and parallelism. Functional MRI and magnetoencephalography, in adults and six-year-olds, supports this hypothesis: while classical convolutional neural networks capture the early visual activity evoked by geometric shapes, subsequent signals from a dorsal parietal and prefrontal network arise from a distinct representation of discrete mathematical features. Thus, the mere perception of a regular quadrilateral suffices to engage a mathematically oriented mode of perception, inadequately captured by current neural networks models."
