            "abstract": "The relationship between conscious experience and brain activity has intrigued scientists and philosophers for centuries. In the last decades, several theories have suggested different accounts for these relationships. These theories have developed in parallel, with little to no cross-talk among them. To advance research on consciousness, we established an adversarial collaboration between proponents of two of the major theories in the field, Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory. Together, we devised and preregistered two experiments that test contrasting predictions of these theories concerning the location and timing of correlates of visual consciousness, which have been endorsed by the theories\u2019 proponents. Predicted outcomes should either support, refute, or challenge these theories. Six theory-impartial laboratories will follow the study protocol specified here, using three complementary methods: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magneto-Electroencephalography (M-EEG), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The study protocol will include built-in replications, both between labs and within datasets. Through this ambitious undertaking, we hope to provide decisive evidence in favor or against the two theories and clarify the footprints of conscious visual perception in the human brain, while also providing an innovative model of large-scale, collaborative, and open science practice."

This highly rapid and complex human behavior is known to engage the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in the language-dominant hemisphere, yet whether there are distinct contributions of these regions to sentence reading is still unclear. To probe these neural spatiotemporal dynamics, we used direct intracranial recordings to measure neural activity while reading sentences, meaning-deficient Jabberwocky sentences, and lists of words or pseudowords. We isolated two functionally and spatiotemporally distinct frontotemporal networks, each sensitive to distinct aspects of word and sentence composition. The first distributed network engages the IFG and MTG, with IFG activity preceding MTG. Activity in this network ramps up over the duration of a sentence and is \u2026"

Here, we directly tested this idea by submitting the neural responses of sleeping 3-month-old infants, measured with high-density electroencephalography (EEG), to decoders designed to disentangle numerical and non-numerical information. The results show the emergence, in approximately 400 ms, of a decodable number representation, independent of physical parameters, that separates auditory sequences of 4 vs. 12 tones and generalizes to visual arrays of 4 vs. 12 objects. Thus, the infant brain contains a number code that transcends sensory modality, sequential or simultaneous presentation, and arousal state."

These theories have independently accrued evidence, yet, confirmation bias and dependence on design choices hamper progress in the field. Here, we present an open science adversarial collaboration which directly juxtaposes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), employing a theory-neutral consortium approach. We investigate neural correlates of the content and duration of visual experience. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex.

Here, we tested a prediction of the dual-route model: as fluency increases, these variations may reflect a decreasing reliance on decoding and an increasing reliance on the lexical route. Method 1,500 French 6th graders passed a one-minute speeded reading-aloud task evaluating fluency, and a 10-minute computerized lexical decision task evaluating the impact of word length, word frequency and pseudoword type. Results As predicted, the word length effect varied dramatically with reading fluency, with the least fluent group showing a length effect even for frequent words. The frequency effect also varied, but solely in proportion to overall slowness, suggesting that frequency affects the decision stage in all readers, while length impacts poor readers disproportionately. Response times and errors were also affected by pseudoword type (e.g. letter substitutions or transpositions), but these effects did not vary much with fluency. Overall, lexical decision variables were excellent predictors of reading fluency (r=0.62). Conclusion Our results call attention to middle-school reading difficulties and encourage the use of lexical decision as a test of students' mental lexicon and the automatization of reading."

            "abstract": "Reading is a complex process involving multiple stages whose impairment may cause distinct types of reading deficits. We describe the Malabi, a screener to identify deficits in various orthographic, lexical, and sublexical components in French. Malabi uses stimuli sensitive to different dyslexias, including attentional dyslexia, an impairment in letter-to-word binding leading to letter migrations between words (\u201cbar cat\u201d may be misread as \u201cbat car\u201d), and letter-position dyslexia, leading to letter transposition errors (\u201cdestiny\u201d may be misread as \u201cdensity\u201d). After collecting reading error norms from 138 French middle-school students, we analyzed error types of 16 dyslexic students. We identified three selective cases of attentional dyslexia and one case of letter-position dyslexia. Further tests replicated our interpretation and explored factors modulating letter migration between- and within- words. Our results support prior evidence of multiple developmental dyslexias, including deficits rooted in impaired orthographic rather than phonological processing."

            "abstract": "A lavishly illustrated and accessibly explained deep dive into the major new findings from cognitive neuroscience. Who are we? To this age-old question, contemporary neuroscience gives a simple answer: we are exquisite neuronal machines. Each of our dreams, thoughts, and feelings arises from a pattern of activity in our brain. In Stanislas Dehaene\u2019s Seeing the Mind, we learn not only that the mind maps onto the brain, but that it is just a complex electrical motif on the tapestry of our neurons. In this richly illustrated and highly accessible book, Dehaene uses the power of brain images to tell the story of centuries-old efforts to understand who we are, and how it is possible that our thoughts emerge from just three pounds of flesh. Seeing the Mind is divided into one hundred topics, each described by a spectacular full-page color image and, on the facing page, a brief text that explains what this image means and why it matters. By weaving together images and text, the book brings readers into the intimacy of their own brains. As Dehaene explains,\u201cAll the gorgeous biological processes that you are about to discover are taking place, right now, inside your own brain.\u201d A modern cabinet of curiosities, Seeing the Mind is an intriguing and memorable read that will astonish readers with a direct, face-to-face meeting with themselves\u2014and with the material stuff of their thoughts and dreams."

We investigate neural correlates of the content and duration of visual experience. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation12. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex.

We find a minimum level of core intuitive graphicacy even in unschooled participants living in remote Namibian villages (N\u2009=\u200987) and 6-year-old 1st-graders who never read a graph (N\u2009=\u200927).

Ten typical imagers and 10 aphantasic individuals performed imagery and perceptual tasks in five domains: object shape, object color, written words, faces, and spatial relationships. In typical imagers, imagery tasks activated left-hemisphere fronto-parietal areas, a domain-general area in the left fusiform gyrus (the Fusiform Imagery Node), together with the relevant domain-preferring areas in the ventral temporal cortex. In aphantasic individuals, imagery activated similar areas, but the Fusiform Imagery Node was functionally disconnected from fronto-parietal areas. Our results unveil the domain-general and domain-specific circuits of visual mental imagery, their functional disorganization in aphantasia, and support the general hypothesis that subjective visual experience - whether perceived or imagined - depends on the integrated activity of high-level visual cortex and fronto-parietal networks."

            "abstract": "The emergence of symbolic thinking has been proposed as a dominant cognitive criterion to distinguish humans from other primates during hominization. Although the proper definition of a symbol has been the subject of much debate, one of its simplest features is bidirectional attachment: the content is accessible from the symbol, and vice versa. Behavioral observations scattered over the past four decades suggest that this criterion might not be met in non-human primates, as they fail to generalize an association learned in one temporal order (A to B) to the reverse order (B to A). Here, we designed an implicit fMRI test to investigate the neural mechanisms of arbitrary audio-visual and visual-visual pairing in monkeys and humans and probe their spontaneous reversibility. After learning a unidirectional association, humans showed surprise signals when this learned association was violated. Crucially, this effect occurred spontaneously in both learned and reversed directions, within an extended network of high-level brain areas, including, but also going beyond the language network. In monkeys, by contrast, violations of association effects occurred solely in the learned direction and were largely confined to sensory areas. We propose that a human-specific brain network may have evolved the capacity for reversible symbolic reference."
