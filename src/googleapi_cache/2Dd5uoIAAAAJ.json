            "abstract": "During discourse comprehension, every new word adds to an evolving representation of meaning that accumulates over consecutive sentences and constrains the next words. To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word 'she', to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells' preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension. This study uniquely demonstrates, at the single-cell level, how memory and language are linked."

            "abstract": "Recent studies showed that humans, regardless of age, education, and culture, can extract the linear trend of a noisy graph. Here, we examined whether such skills for intuitive statistics are confined to humans or may also exist in non-human primates. We trained Guinea baboons (Papio papio) to associate arbitrary geometrical shapes with the increasing or decreasing trends of noiseless and noisy scatterplots, while varying the number of points, the noise level, and the regression slope. Many baboons successfully learned this conditional match-to-sample task for both noiseless and noisy plots. Crucially, for successful baboons, accuracy varied as a sigmoid function of the t-value of the regression, the same statistical index upon which humans also base their answers, even after controlling for other variables. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the human perception of data graphics is based on the pre-emption and recycling of a phylogenetically older competence of the primate visual system for extracting the principal axes of visual displays."

            "abstract": "Reading is a complex process involving multiple stages. An impairment in any of these stages may cause distinct types of reading deficits-distinct types of dyslexia. We describe the Malabi, a screener to identify deficits in various orthographic, lexical, and sublexical components of the reading process in French. The Malabi utilizes stimuli that are sensitive to different forms of dyslexia, including\" attentional dyslexia\", as it is traditionally refered to, characterized by letter-to-word binding impairments leading to letter migrations between words (eg,\" bar cat\" misread as\" bat car\"), and\" letter-position dyslexia\", resulting in letter transpositions within words (eg,\" destiny\" misread as\" density\"). After collecting reading error norms from 138 French middle-school students, we analyzed error types of 16 students with developmental dyslexia. We identified three selective cases of attentional dyslexia and one case of letter-position dyslexia. Further tests confirmed our diagnosis and demonstrate, for the first time, how these dyslexias are manifested in French. These results underscore the significance of recognizing and discussing the existence of multiple dyslexias, both in research contexts when selecting participants for dyslexia studies, and in practical settings where educators and practitioners work with students to develop personalized support. The test and supporting materials are available on Open Science Framework (https://osf. io/3pgzb/)."

We argue that number-to-line tasks are a great probe, as children need to think about magnitude and have many opportunities for error. We tested 26,000 pupils from 6th to 10th grades and analyzed their errors. In 6th grade, 80% of the responses were wrong; 45% were still so in 10th grade. We observed seven error patterns. In particular, younger and lower-performing children mostly confused fractions with decimals; older and higher-performing children rather placed the inverse of the target fraction. All grades also confused the roles of the numerator and the denominator. We propose that children use two strategies: they either convert the target fraction into a decimal or partition the line into units to count. We discuss theoretical (strategy choice vs. strategy execution) and pedagogical (identify and remediate misunderstandings) implications."

Previous neuroimaging studies, primarily utilizing 3T scanners, have identified an extensive fronto-temporal network involved in forming linguistic structures and executing merge operations. Intracranial recordings in these areas reveal a more distributed picture, with adjacent regions undertaking diverse linguistic tasks. We designed a 7T fMRI visual task to investigate the neural coding of syntactic operations. In healthy French-speaking participants, we initially identified the language network using a localizer. Subsequently, we employed short 3-word stimuli, presented briefly (200ms), to explore the response profiles within the language network. These stimuli included control conditions, affirmative statements, and interrogative sentences, all matched for letter and character count. Preliminary results indicate that 200ms is sufficient to differentiate between sentences and non-sentences, and suggest a finely-tuned specialization for syntactic operations within language network subregions."

In contrast, non-human primates exhibit very limited proficiency in recognizing abstract representations. This research delves into this human singularity for visual abstraction, through neuroimaging experiments conducted in both humans and non-human primates. Stimuli presenting the same concept (e.g. a house or a face) but varying in abstraction levels (photos, drawings, symbols, and words) were initially presented to a monkey, while intracranial recording of his brain were obtained (16 Utah arrays distributed in V1, V4 and IT). Preliminary results indicate that monkey display early signs of abstraction, particularly for evolutionarily ancient categories such as faces. MEG and fMRI recordings of human subjects are also currently underway, striving to unveil the neuronal mechanisms that set our species apart in the domain of visual abstraction."

While many studies have focused on subsets of math concepts such as numbers, fractions, or geometric shapes, few have ventured beyond these elementary domains. Here, we attempted to map out the full space of math concepts and to answer two specific questions: can distributed semantic models, such a GloVe, provide a satisfactory fit to human semantic judgments in mathematics? And how does this fit vary with education? We first analyzed all of the French and English Wikipedia pages with math contents, and used a semi-automatic procedure to extract the 1,000 most frequent math terms in both languages. In a second step, we collected extensive behavioral judgments of familiarity and semantic similarity between them. About half of the variance in human similarity judgments was explained by vector embeddings that attempt to capture latent semantic structures based on cooccurence statistics. Participants' self-reported level of education modulated familiarity and similarity, allowing us to create a partial hierarchy among high-level math concepts. Our results converge onto the proposal of a map of math space, organized as a database of math terms with information about their frequency, familiarity, grade of acquisition, and entanglement with other concepts."

To this age-old question, contemporary neuroscience gives a simple answer: we are exquisite neuronal machines. Each of our dreams, thoughts, and feelings arises from a pattern of activity in our brain. In Stanislas Dehaene\u2019s Seeing the Mind, we learn not only that the mind maps onto the brain, but that it is just a complex electrical motif on the tapestry of our neurons. In this richly illustrated and highly accessible book, Dehaene uses the power of brain images to tell the story of centuries-old efforts to understand who we are, and how it is possible that our thoughts emerge from just three pounds of flesh. Seeing the Mind is divided into one hundred topics, each described by a spectacular full-page color image and, on the facing page, a brief text that explains what this image means and why it matters. By weaving together images and text, the book brings readers into the intimacy of their own brains. As Dehaene explains,\u201cAll the gorgeous biological processes that you are about to discover are taking place, right now, inside your own brain.\u201d A modern cabinet of curiosities, Seeing the Mind is an intriguing and memorable read that will astonish readers with a direct, face-to-face meeting with themselves\u2014and with the material stuff of their thoughts and dreams."

Method: 1,501 French 6th graders passed a one-minute speeded reading-aloud task evaluating fluency, and a ten-minute computerized lexical decision task evaluating the impact of lexicality, length, word frequency and pseudoword type. Results: As predicted, the word length effect varied dramatically with reading fluency, with the least fluent students showing a length effect even for frequent words. The frequency effect also varied, but solely in proportion to overall reading speed, suggesting that frequency affects the decision stage similarly \u2026"

In this study, we explore whether ketamine triggers psychotic-like symptoms in healthy controls through a disruption of conscious access.MethodsWe administered ketamine and placebo to 22 healthy volunteers (within-subject randomized design) and recorded brain activity with electroencephalography during a perceptual task. In this task, participants had to categorize a sound and a masked digit, and to assess the digit visibility. Delays between the sound and the digit, and the digit and the mask, were varied to manipulate the interference between the sound and the digit and to control the digit \u2026"

Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate highly similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of sizes and absolute positions. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by training deep neural network models to recognize written words and then analyzing how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across different layers of the network. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the \"visual word form area\" of the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their distance from the blank space at the left or right of a word, thus acting as \"space bigrams\". These units specifically encode ordinal positions and operate by pooling across low and high-frequency detector units from early layers of the network. The proposed neural code provides a mechanistic insight into how information on letter identity and position is extracted and allow for invariant word recognition, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading."

We formulate and test the hypothesis that, beyond an evolutionarily ancient ventral visual circuit for object recognition, the perception of geometry also relies on an additional system encoding discrete regularities such as symmetries and parallelism. Functional MRI and magnetoencephalography, in adults and six-year-olds, supports this hypothesis: while classical convolutional neural networks capture the early visual activity evoked by geometric shapes, subsequent signals from a dorsal parietal and prefrontal network arise from a distinct representation of discrete mathematical features. Thus, the mere perception of a regular quadrilateral suffices to engage a mathematically oriented mode of perception, inadequately captured by current neural networks models."

We rely on the Fast Shared Response Model (FastSRM): an analytical tool that provides a data-driven solution to model naturalistic stimuli, typically containing many features. We show that data from left-out runs can be reconstructed using FastSRM, thus enabling the extraction of functional networks pertaining to vision, audio and language systems. We also present an in-depth study of the topographic organization of the visual system through a retinotopy task.

In the last decades, several theories have suggested different accounts for these relationships. These theories have developed in parallel, with little to no cross-talk among them. To advance research on consciousness, we established an adversarial collaboration between proponents of two of the major theories in the field, Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory. Together, we devised and preregistered two experiments that test contrasting predictions of these theories concerning the location and timing of correlates of visual consciousness, which have been endorsed by the theories\u2019 proponents. Predicted outcomes should either support, refute, or challenge these theories. Six theory-impartial laboratories will follow the study protocol specified here, using three complementary methods: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magneto-Electroencephalography (M-EEG), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The study protocol will include built-in replications, both between labs and within datasets. Through this ambitious undertaking, we hope to provide decisive evidence in favor or against the two theories and clarify the footprints of conscious visual perception in the human brain, while also providing an innovative model of large-scale, collaborative, and open science practice."

These theories have independently accrued evidence, yet, confirmation bias and dependence on design choices hamper progress in the field. Here, we present an open science adversarial collaboration which directly juxtaposes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), employing a theory-neutral consortium approach. We investigate neural correlates of the content and duration of visual experience. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex. Beyond challenging the theories themselves, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive \u2026"

In three experiments, we investigated human adults\u2019 capacity to evaluate the linear trend of a flashed scatterplot comprising 0\u20134 outlier datapoints. Experiment 1 showed that participants did not spontaneously reject outliers: when outliers were not mentioned, their presence biased the participants\u2019 trend judgments and regression line estimates. In Experiment 2, where participants were explicitly asked to exclude outliers, the outlier-induced bias was reduced but remained significant. In Experiment 3, where participants were asked to explicitly detect any outlier before adjusting their regression line, outlier detection was satisfactory \u2026"

The results show the emergence, in approximately 400 ms, of a decodable number representation, independent of physical parameters, that separates auditory sequences of 4 vs. 12 tones and generalizes to visual arrays of 4 vs. 12 objects. Thus, the infant brain contains a number code that transcends sensory modality, sequential or simultaneous presentation, and arousal state."

Here, we tested a prediction of the dual-route model: as fluency increases, these variations may reflect a decreasing reliance on decoding and an increasing reliance on the lexical route. Method 1,500 French 6th graders passed a one-minute speeded reading-aloud task evaluating fluency, and a 10-minute computerized lexical decision task evaluating the impact of word length, word frequency and pseudoword type. Results As predicted, the word length effect varied dramatically with reading fluency, with the least fluent group showing a length effect even for frequent words. The frequency effect also varied, but solely in proportion to overall slowness, suggesting that frequency affects the decision stage in all readers, while length impacts poor readers disproportionately. Response times and errors were also affected by pseudoword type (e.g. letter substitutions or transpositions), but these effects did not vary much with fluency. Overall, lexical decision variables were excellent predictors of reading fluency (r=0.62). Conclusion Our results call attention to middle-school reading difficulties and encourage the use of lexical decision as a test of students' mental lexicon and the automatization of reading."

We describe the Malabi, a screener to identify deficits in various orthographic, lexical, and sublexical components in French. Malabi uses stimuli sensitive to different dyslexias, including attentional dyslexia, an impairment in letter-to-word binding leading to letter migrations between words (\u201cbar cat\u201d may be misread as \u201cbat car\u201d), and letter-position dyslexia, leading to letter transposition errors (\u201cdestiny\u201d may be misread as \u201cdensity\u201d). After collecting reading error norms from 138 French middle-school students, we analyzed error types of 16 dyslexic students. We identified three selective cases of attentional dyslexia and one case of letter-position dyslexia. Further tests replicated our interpretation and explored factors modulating letter migration between- and within- words. Our results support prior evidence of multiple developmental dyslexias, including deficits rooted in impaired orthographic rather than phonological processing."

In typical imagers, imagery tasks activated left-hemisphere fronto-parietal areas, a domain-general area in the left fusiform gyrus (the Fusiform Imagery Node), together with the relevant domain-preferring areas in the ventral temporal cortex. In aphantasic individuals, imagery activated similar areas, but the Fusiform Imagery Node was functionally disconnected from fronto-parietal areas. Our results unveil the domain-general and domain-specific circuits of visual mental imagery, their functional disorganization in aphantasia, and support the general hypothesis that subjective visual experience - whether perceived or imagined - depends on the integrated activity of high-level visual cortex and fronto-parietal networks."

We tested this theory by probing memory for 16-item sequences made of two sounds. We recorded brain activity with functional MRI and magneto-encephalography (MEG) while participants listened to a hierarchy of sequences of variable complexity, whose minimal description required transition probabilities, chunking, or nested structures. Occasional deviant sounds probed the participants\u2019 knowledge of the sequence. We predicted that task difficulty and brain activity would be proportional to the complexity derived from the minimal description length in our formal language. Furthermore, activity should increase with complexity for learned sequences, and decrease with complexity for deviants. These predictions were upheld in both fMRI and MEG, indicating that sequence predictions are highly dependent on sequence structure and become weaker and delayed as complexity increases. The proposed language recruited bilateral superior temporal, precentral, anterior intraparietal, and cerebellar cortices. These regions overlapped extensively with a localizer for mathematical calculation, and much less with spoken or written language processing. We propose that these areas collectively encode regular sequences as repetitions with variations and their recursive composition into nested structures."

To this age-old question, contemporary neuroscience gives a simple answer: we are exquisite neuronal machines. Each of our dreams, thoughts, and feelings arises from a pattern of activity in our brain. In Stanislas Dehaene\u2019s Seeing the Mind, we learn not only that the mind maps onto the brain, but that it is just a complex electrical motif on the tapestry of our neurons. In this richly illustrated and highly accessible book, Dehaene uses the power of brain images to tell the story of centuries-old efforts to understand who we are, and how it is possible that our thoughts emerge from just three pounds of flesh. Seeing the Mind is divided into one hundred topics, each described by a spectacular full-page color image and, on the facing page, a brief text that explains what this image means and why it matters. By weaving together images and text, the book brings readers into the intimacy of their own brains. As Dehaene explains,\u201cAll the gorgeous biological processes that you are about to discover are taking place, right now, inside your own brain.\u201d A modern cabinet of curiosities, Seeing the Mind is an intriguing and memorable read that will astonish readers with a direct, face-to-face meeting with themselves\u2014and with the material stuff of their thoughts and dreams."

            "abstract": "According to the language of thought hypothesis, regular sequences are compressed in human memory using recursive loops akin to a mental program that predicts future items. We tested this theory by probing memory for 16-item sequences made of two sounds. We recorded brain activity with functional MRI and magneto-encephalography (MEG) while participants listened to a hierarchy of sequences of variable complexity, whose minimal description required transition probabilities, chunking, or nested structures. Occasional deviant sounds probed the participants\u2019 knowledge of the sequence. We predicted that task difficulty and brain activity would be proportional to the complexity derived from the minimal description length in our formal language. Furthermore, activity should increase with complexity for learned sequences, and decrease with complexity for deviants. These predictions were upheld in both fMRI and MEG, indicating that sequence predictions are highly dependent on sequence structure and become weaker and delayed as complexity increases. The proposed language recruited bilateral superior temporal, precentral, anterior intraparietal and cerebellar cortices. These regions overlapped extensively with a localizer for mathematical calculation, and much less with spoken or written language processing. We propose that these areas collectively encode regular sequences as repetitions with variations and their recursive composition into nested structures."

The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation12. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex.

Loss of consciousness might disrupt this temporal organization leaving patients unresponsive. We hypothesized that characterizing brain activity in terms of transient events may provide a signature of consciousness. For this, we analyzed temporal dynamics of spatiotemporally overlapping functional networks obtained from fMRI transient activity across different states of consciousness. We first show a striking homology in spatial organization of networks between monkeys and humans, indicating cross-species similarities in resting-state fMRI structure. We then tracked how network organization shifts under different anesthesia conditions in macaque monkeys. While the spatial aspect of the networks was preserved, their temporal dynamics were highly affected by anesthesia. Networks expressed for longer durations and co-activated in an anesthetic-specific configuration. Additionally, hierarchical brain organization was disrupted with a consciousness-level-signature role of the default mode network. In conclusion, network temporal dynamics is a reliable and robust cortical signature of consciousness, paving the way to its clinical translation."

            "abstract": "The emergence of symbolic thinking has been proposed as a dominant cognitive criterion to distinguish humans from other primates during hominization. Although the proper definition of a symbol has been the subject of much debate, one of its simplest features is bidirectional attachment: the content is accessible from the symbol, and vice versa. Behavioral observations scattered over the past four decades suggest that this criterion might not be met in non-human primates, as they fail to generalize an association learned in one temporal order (A to B) to the reverse order (B to A). Here, we designed an implicit fMRI test to investigate the neural mechanisms of arbitrary audio-visual and visual-visual pairing in monkeys and humans and probe their spontaneous reversibility. After learning a unidirectional association, humans showed surprise signals when this learned association was violated. Crucially, this effect occurred spontaneously in both learned and reversed directions, within an extended network of high-level brain areas, including, but also going beyond the language network. In monkeys, by contrast, violations of association effects occurred solely in the learned direction and were largely confined to sensory areas. We propose that a human-specific brain network may have evolved the capacity for reversible symbolic reference."
