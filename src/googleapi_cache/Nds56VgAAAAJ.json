Here, naturalistic stimuli were used to induce neural synchrony across early deaf and hearing individuals. Participants watched a silent animated film in an intact version and three versions with gradually distorted meaning. Differences between groups were observed in higher-order auditory cortices in all stimuli, with no significant effects in the primary auditory cortex. Comparison between levels of scrambling revealed a heterogeneity of function in secondary auditory areas. Both hemispheres showed greater synchrony for the intact movie than for low-level variants. However, the right hemisphere showed an increased inter-subject synchrony for the low-level movie variants, which was not present on the left. An event segmentation validated these results: the dynamics of the right secondary auditory cortex unfolded as shorter length events with more transitions than the left. It also uncovered a further left-right asymmetry: Only left-hemisphere patterns matched the patterns of the hippocampus, a brain region situated at the top of cortical hierarchy. Our results reveal how deaf subjects use their auditory cortex to process visual meaning."

But how do blind individuals perceive their bodies without visual cues, and does the brain of a blind person integrate bodily senses differently from a sighted person? To address this question, we aimed to replicate the only two previous studies on this topic, which claimed that blind individuals do not experience the somatic rubber hand illusion, a bodily illusion triggered by the integration of correlated tactile and proprioceptive signals from the two hands. We used a larger sample size than the previous studies and added Bayesian analyses to examine statistical evidence in favor of the lack of an illusion effect. Moreover, we employed tests to investigate whether enhanced tactile acuity and cardiac interoceptive accuracy in blind individuals could also explain the weaker illusion. We tested 36 blind individuals and 36 age-and sex-matched sighted volunteers. The results show that blind individuals do not experience the somatic rubber hand illusion based on questionnaire ratings and behavioral measures that assessed changes in hand position sense toward the location of the rubber hand. This conclusion is supported by Bayesian evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Tactile acuity was not correlated with illusion measures in either group, but cardiac interoceptive accuracy was negatively correlated with questionnaire ratings of illusion strength in the sighted group. The findings confirm that blind individuals do not experience the somatic rubber hand illusion, indicating that lack of visual \u2026"

            "abstract": "IntroductionADHD is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders and affects the daily functioning of families raising children with this condition. Among the symptoms typical for ADHD, low effectiveness of executive functions can determine the quality of family life.ObjectivesThis study aimed to specify whether family communication and satisfaction as reported by a parent are predictors of a child\u2019s executive functioning quality and whether ADHD severity lies on the pathway between the two. Moreover, the child\u2019s sex effect was checked.MethodsThe study included 200 Polish participants (nGirls = 56) from the NeuroSmog project aged 10-13 diagnosed with ADHD according to the ICD-11. Stanford-Binet 5 Intelligence Scale, PU1 Cognitive Diagnosis Battery, Conners 3 ADHD Diagnosis Questionnaire, and the FACES IV Questionnaire were used to derive needed information. Structural \u2026"

            "abstract": "For bilinguals, speaking in a second language (L2) compared to the native language (L1) is usually more difficult. In this study we asked whether the difficulty in L2 production reflects increased demands imposed on domain-general or core language mechanisms. We compared the brain response to speech production in L1 and L2 within two functionally-defined networks in the brain: the Multiple Demand (MD) network and the Language network. We found that speech production in L2 was linked to a widespread increase of brain activity in the domain-general MD network. The Language network did not show a similarly robust differences in processing speech in the two languages, however, we found increased response to L2 production in the language-specific portion of the left IFG. To further explore our results, we have looked at domain-general and language-specific response within the brain structures postulated to form a Bilingual Language Control network. Within this network, we found a robust increase in response to L2 in the domain-general, but also in some language-specific voxels including in the left IFG. Our findings show that L2 production strongly engages domain-general mechanisms, but only locally affects language-specific processing. These results put constrain on the current model of bilingual language control."
