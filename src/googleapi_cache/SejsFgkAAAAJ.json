Neurons in inferotemporal (IT) cortex represent the sensory percept of visual objects using a distributed axis code, \u2013. Whether and how the same IT neural population represents the long-term memory of visual objects remains unclear. Here we examined how familiar faces are encoded in the IT anterior medial face patch (AM), perirhinal face patch (PR) and temporal pole face patch (TP). In AM and PR we observed that the encoding axis for familiar faces is rotated relative to that for unfamiliar faces at long latency; in TP this memory-related rotation was much weaker. Contrary to previous claims, the relative response magnitude to familiar versus unfamiliar faces was not a stable indicator of familiarity in any patch, , , , , \u2013.

            "abstract": "Vision is widely understood as an inference problem. However, two contrasting conceptions of the inference process have each been influential in research on biological vision as well as the engineering of machine vision. The first emphasizes bottom-up signal flow, describing vision as a largely feedforward, discriminative inference process that filters and transforms the visual information to remove irrelevant variation and represent behaviorally relevant information in a format suitable for downstream functions of cognition and behavioral control. In this conception, vision is driven by the sensory data, and perception is direct because the processing proceeds from the data to the latent variables of interest. The notion of \"inference\" in this conception is that of the engineering literature on neural networks, where feedforward convolutional neural networks processing images are said to perform inference. The alternative conception is that of vision as an inference process in Helmholtz's sense, where the sensory evidence is evaluated in the context of a generative model of the causal processes giving rise to it. In this conception, vision inverts a generative model through an interrogation of the evidence in a process often thought to involve top-down predictions of sensory data to evaluate the likelihood of alternative hypotheses. The authors include scientists rooted in roughly equal numbers in each of the conceptions and motivated to overcome what might be a false dichotomy between them and engage the other perspective in the realm of theory and experiment. The primate brain employs an unknown algorithm that may combine the advantages of \u2026"

According to this idea, neurons encode stimuli through fixed mappings of stimulus features to firing rates. Here, we report that the tuning of visual neurons can rapidly and coherently change across a population to attend to a whole and its parts. We set out to investigate a longstanding debate concerning whether inferotemporal (IT) cortex uses a specialized code for representing specific types of objects or whether it uses a general code that applies to any object. We found that face cells in macaque IT cortex initially adopted a general code optimized for face detection. But following a rapid, concerted population event lasting < 20 ms, the neural code transformed into a face-specific one with two striking properties: (i) response gradients to principal detection-related dimensions reversed direction, and (ii) new tuning \u2026"

Existing technologies, however, have provided limited functionality in nonhuman primate species such as macaques, which offer close models of human cognition and behavior. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance of Neuropixels 1.0-NHP, a high channel count linear electrode array designed to enable large-scale simultaneous recording in superficial and deep structures within the macaque or other large animal brain. These devices were fabricated in two versions: 4416 electrodes along a 45 mm shank, and 2496 along a 25 mm shank. For both versions, users can programmatically select 384 channels, enabling simultaneous multi-area recording with a single probe. We demonstrate recording from over 3000 single neurons within a session, and simultaneous recordings from over 1000 neurons using multiple probes. This technology represents a significant increase in recording access and scalability relative to existing technologies, and enables new classes of experiments involving fine-grained electrophysiological characterization of brain areas, functional connectivity between cells, and simultaneous brain-wide recording at scale."

In the primate, researchers have argued from both behavioral and neural evidence that a key step in visual representation is \u2018figure-ground segmentation\u2019, the delineation of figures as distinct from backgrounds. To determine if mice also show behavioral and neural signatures of figure-ground segmentation, we trained mice on a figure-ground segmentation task where figures were defined by gratings and naturalistic textures moving counterphase to the background. Unlike primates, mice were severely limited in their ability to segment figure from ground using the opponent motion cue, with segmentation behavior strongly dependent on the specific carrier pattern. Remarkably, when mice were forced to localize naturalistic patterns defined by opponent motion, they adopted a strategy of brute force memorization of texture patterns. In contrast, primates, including humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs, could readily segment figures independent of carrier pattern using the opponent motion cue. Consistent with mouse behavior, neural responses to the same stimuli recorded in mouse visual areas V1, RL, and LM also did not support texture-invariant segmentation of figures using opponent motion. Modeling revealed that the texture dependence of both the mouse\u2019s behavior and neural responses could be explained by a feedforward neural network lacking explicit segmentation capabilities.

First, it is unclear whether these cells encode segmentation consistently since most studies used only a limited variety of stimulus types. Second, it is unclear whether these cells are organized into specialized modules or instead randomly scattered across the visual cortex: the former would lend credence to a functional role for putative segmentation cells. Here, we used fMRI-guided electrophysiology to systematically characterize the consistency and spatial organization of segmentation-encoding cells across the visual cortex.

To address this issue, we developed a new mouse model, the double transgenic Pou4f3+/DTR x Thy1-GCaMP6s, which allows for inducible deafening using diphtheria toxin and minimizes off-target effects of UNM while allowing effects on neural activity to be visualized with fluorescent calcium imaging. Using this model, we found that the auditory confounds caused by FUS can be significantly reduced or eliminated within a certain pressure range. At higher pressures, FUS can result in focal fluorescence dips at the target, elicit non-auditory sensory confounds, and damage tissue, leading to spreading depolarization. Under the acoustic conditions we tested, we did not observe direct calcium responses in the mouse cortex. Our findings provide a cleaner animal model for UNM and sonogenetics research, establish a parameter range within which off-target effects are confidently avoided, and reveal the non-auditory side effects of higher-pressure stimulation."
