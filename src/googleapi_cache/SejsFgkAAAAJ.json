This process may be combined with multiphoton or magnetic resonance imaging to produce multimodal atlases in large, gyrencephalic brains."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities \u2013 inherited from over 500 million years of evolution \u2013 that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

Existing technologies, however, have provided limited functionality in nonhuman primate species such as macaques, which offer close models of human cognition and behavior. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance of Neuropixels 1.0-NHP, a high channel count linear electrode array designed to enable large-scale simultaneous recording in superficial and deep structures within the macaque or other large animal brain. These devices were fabricated in two versions: 4416 electrodes along a 45 mm shank, and 2496 along a 25 mm shank. For both versions, users can programmatically select 384 channels, enabling simultaneous multi-area recording with a single probe. We demonstrate recording from over 3000 single neurons within a session, and simultaneous recordings from over 1000 neurons using multiple probes. This technology represents a significant increase in recording access and scalability relative to existing technologies, and enables new classes of experiments involving fine-grained electrophysiological characterization of brain areas, functional connectivity between cells, and simultaneous brain-wide recording at scale."

In the primate, researchers have argued from both behavioral and neural evidence that a key step in visual representation is \u2018figure-ground segmentation\u2019, the delineation of figures as distinct from backgrounds. To determine if mice also show behavioral and neural signatures of figure-ground segmentation, we trained mice on a figure-ground segmentation task where figures were defined by gratings and naturalistic textures moving counterphase to the background. Unlike primates, mice were severely limited in their ability to segment figure from ground using the opponent motion cue, with segmentation behavior strongly dependent on the specific carrier pattern. Remarkably, when mice were forced to localize naturalistic patterns defined by opponent motion, they adopted a strategy of brute force memorization of texture patterns. In contrast, primates, including humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs, could readily segment figures independent of carrier pattern using the opponent motion cue. Consistent with mouse behavior, neural responses to the same stimuli recorded in mouse visual areas V1, RL, and LM also did not support texture-invariant segmentation of figures using opponent motion. Modeling revealed that the texture dependence of both the mouse\u2019s behavior and neural responses could be explained by a feedforward neural network lacking explicit segmentation capabilities. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in the ability of \u2026"

Previous studies have reported cells across visual cortex that are modulated by segmentation features, but the functional role of these cells remains unclear. First, it is unclear whether these cells encode segmentation consistently since most studies used only a limited variety of stimulus types. Second, it is unclear whether these cells are organized into specialized modules or instead randomly scattered across the visual cortex: the former would lend credence to a functional role for putative segmentation cells. Here, we used fMRI-guided electrophysiology to systematically characterize the consistency and spatial organization of segmentation-encoding cells across the visual cortex. Using fMRI, we identified a set of patches in V2, V3, V3A, V4, and V4A that were more active for stimuli containing \u2026"

            "abstract": "Recent studies on ultrasonic neuromodulation (UNM) in rodents have shown that focused ultrasound (FUS) can activate peripheral auditory pathways, leading to off-target and brain-wide excitation, which obscures the direct activation of the target area by FUS. To address this issue, we developed a new mouse model, the double transgenic Pou4f3+/DTR x Thy1-GCaMP6s, which allows for inducible deafening using diphtheria toxin and minimizes off-target effects of UNM while allowing effects on neural activity to be visualized with fluorescent calcium imaging. Using this model, we found that the auditory confounds caused by FUS can be significantly reduced or eliminated within a certain pressure range. At higher pressures, FUS can result in focal fluorescence dips at the target, elicit non-auditory sensory confounds, and damage tissue, leading to spreading depolarization. Under the acoustic conditions we tested, we did not observe direct calcium responses in the mouse cortex. Our findings provide a cleaner animal model for UNM and sonogenetics research, establish a parameter range within which off-target effects are confidently avoided, and reveal the non-auditory side effects of higher-pressure stimulation."

Moreover, if consciousness corresponds directly to top-down generated contents, this would elegantly explain the mystery of why our perception of ambiguous images is always consistent across all levels. However, experimental evidence for the existence of a generative model in the visual system remains lacking. I will discuss efforts by my lab to fill this gap through experiments in the macaque face patch system, a set of regions in inferotemporal cortex dedicated to processing faces.
