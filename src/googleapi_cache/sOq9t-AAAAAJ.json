            "abstract": "Understanding how the human brain recognizes faces is a primary scientific goal in cognitive neuroscience. Given the limitations of the monkey model of human face recognition, a key approach in this endeavor is the recording of electrophysiological activity with electrodes implanted inside the brain of human epileptic patients. However, this approach faces a number of challenges that must be overcome for meaningful scientific knowledge to emerge. Here we synthesize a 10 year research program combining the recording of intracerebral activity (StereoElectroEncephaloGraphy, SEEG) in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) of large samples of participants and fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS), to objectively define, quantify, and characterize the neural basis of human face recognition. These large-scale studies reconcile the wide distribution of neural face recognition activity with its (right) hemispheric and regional specialization and extend face-selectivity to anterior regions of the VOTC, including the ventral anterior temporal lobe (VATL) typically affected by magnetic susceptibility artifacts in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Clear spatial dissociations in category-selectivity between faces and other meaningful stimuli such as landmarks (houses, medial VOTC regions) or written words (left lateralized VOTC) are found, confirming and extending neuroimaging observations while supporting the validity of the clinical population tested to inform about normal brain function. The recognition of face identity \u2013 arguably the ultimate form of recognition for the human brain \u2013 beyond mere differences in physical features is \u2026"

While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) localizers can play an essential role in reaching this objective (Russ et al., 2021), they often differ substantially across species in terms of paradigms, measured signals, and data analysis, biasing the comparisons. Here we introduce a functional frequency-tagging face localizer for NHP imaging, successfully developed in humans and outperforming standard face localizers (Gao et al., 2018). FMRI recordings were performed in two awake macaques. Within a rapid 6 Hz stream of natural non-face objects images, human or monkey face stimuli were presented in bursts every 9 s. We also included control conditions with phase-scrambled versions of all images. As in humans, face-selective activity was objectively identified and quantified at the \u2026"

Yet, the cellular mechanisms producing selective responses to faces in this hominoid neuroanatomical structure remain unknown. Here we report single neuron recordings performed in 5 human subjects (1 male, 4 females) implanted with intracerebral microelectrodes in the face-selective midfusiform gyrus, while they viewed pictures of familiar and unknown faces and places.

Both color and grayscale versions of the objects elicited yellow-specific responses, indicating an automatic activation of color knowledge from object shape. Follow-up experiments replicated these effects with green-specific responses, and demonstrated modulated responses for incongruent color/object associations. Importantly, the onset of color-specific responses was as early to grayscale as actually colored stimuli (before 100 ms), the latter additionally eliciting a conventional later response (approximately 140 \u2026"

At the methodological level, increasing the value of DES in cognitive neuroscience will depend on the use of well-controlled and diverse experimental paradigms across enough trials and stimulations to objectively evaluate DES effects.

The ability to recognize these symbols has little in common with the automatic and rapid visual recognition of socially important stimuli in real life. Here we use sweep visual evoked potentials to assess spatial resolution objectively based on the recognition of human faces and written words.Methods: To this end, we tested unfamiliar face individuation 1 and visual word recognition 2 in 15 normally sighted adult volunteers with a 68-electrode electroencephalogram system.Results: Unlike previous measures of low-level visual function including VA, the most sensitive electrode was found at an electrode different from Oz in a majority of participants. Thresholds until which faces and words could be recognized were evaluated at the most sensitive electrode defined individually for each participant. Word recognition thresholds corresponded with the VA level expected from normally sighted participants, and even a VA significantly higher than expected from normally sighted individuals for a few participants.Conclusions: Spatial resolution can be evaluated based on high-level stimuli encountered in day-to-day life, such as faces or written words with sweep visual evoked potentials."
