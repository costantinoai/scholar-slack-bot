Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), especially in the right hemisphere impacts extinction learning; however, the underlying neural mechanisms are elusive. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of cathodal tDCS stimulation to the right dlPFC on neural activity and connectivity patterns during delayed fear extinction in healthy participants.We conducted a two-day fear conditioning and extinction procedure. On the first day, we collected fear-related self-reports, clinical questionnaires, and skin conductance responses during fear acquisition. On the second day, participants in the tDCS group (n = 16) received 20-min offline tDCS before fMRI and then completed the fear extinction session during fMRI. Participants in the control \u2026"

However, because PMO involves conscious visual distortions to faces which participants can report, it can be used to probe fundamental questions about face representations. Here we review cases of PMO that address theoretical questions in visual neuroscience including face specificity, inverted face processing, the importance of the vertical midline, dissociable representations for each half of the face, hemispheric specialization, the relationship between face recognition and conscious face perception, and the reference frames that face representations are embedded within.

            "abstract": "Understanding how we recognize everyday objects requires unravelling the variables that govern the way we think about objects and the way in which our representations are organized neurally. A major hypothesis is that the organization of object knowledge follows key object-related dimensions, analogously to how sensory information is organized in the brain. Here, we explored, behaviorally and neurally, the multidimensionality of object processing. We focused on within-domain object information as a proxy for the kinds of object decision tasks we typically engage in our daily lives \u2014 e.g., identifying a knife from other types of manipulable objects such as spoons, axes or screwdrivers. To do so, we extracted object-related dimensions from subjective human judgments on a set of objects from a particular object domain \u2014 i.e., manipulable objects. We demonstrated that the extracted dimensions are cognitively interpretable \u2014 i.e., participants are able to label them; are cognitively relevant for manipulable object processing \u2014 i.e., categorization decisions are guided by these dimensions; and are important for the neural organization of knowledge \u2014 i.e., they are good predictors of the neural signals elicited by manipulable objects. This shows that multidimensionality is a hallmark of the organization of object knowledge in the brain."

            "abstract": "Neuroplasticity is the ability of the human brain to reorganize and modify its activity throughout life. In congenital deafness, sensory-deprived cortex can be recruited to represent sensory information belonging to other modalities, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. Previous studies have indicated that the auditory cortex of congenitally deaf, but not of hearing individuals, is recruited during visual tasks. However, it is not clear to what extent, and how, these cross-modal responses in the deprived auditory cortex represent low-level visual spatial information or map the visual field. Here, we addressed this question directly in an fMRI case-study, aiming to map retinotopic features in the auditory cortex. Two congenitally deaf and one hearing participant went through a conventional retinotopy fMRI experiment with visual stimuli designed to map the visual system. Using population receptive field (pRF) modelling, we revealed retinotopic-related responses in the auditory cortex of the deaf, but not in the hearing. These responses, that were mostly lateralized to the right hemisphere, represented the contralateral visual field, and were characterized by large receptive fields, centred to near foveal areas. Interestingly, we found that these responses to visual stimuli predominantly reflected negative BOLD signals in the auditory cortex of the deaf, suggesting that visual information might be represented through cross-modal deactivation signals."

Traditionally, semantic norms focus on a variety of object categories, and, as a result, have a small number of concepts per semantic category. Here, our main goal is to create a more finely-tuned feature database exclusively for one category of objects - manipulable objects. This database contributes to the understanding of within-category, content-specific processing. To achieve this, we asked 130 participants to freely generate features for 80 manipulable objects, and another group of 32 participants to generate action features for the same objects. We then compared our databases with other published semantic norms and found high structural similarity between them. In our databases, we calculated the similarity between visual, functional, encyclopedic, and action feature types. We discovered that objects were grouped in a distinctive and meaningful way according to feature type. Finally, we tested the validity of our databases by asking three groups of participants to perform a feature verification task while manipulating production frequency. Our results demonstrate that participants can recognize and associate the features of our databases with specific manipulable objects. Participants were faster to verify high-frequency features than low-frequency features. Overall, our data provide important insights into how we process manipulable objects and can be used to further inform cognitive \u2026"
