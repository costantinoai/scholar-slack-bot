The ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interactions and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors. Considerable evidence from behavioural, neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations supports the hypothesis that humans have specialized cognitive and neural mechanisms dedicated to the perception of faces (the face-specificity hypothesis). Here, we review the literature on a region of the human brain that appears to play a key role in face perception, known as the fusiform face area (FFA).Section 1 outlines the theoretical background for much of this work.

Subjects discriminated pairs of upright or inverted faces or house stimuli that differed in either the spatial distance among parts (configuration) or the shape of the parts. The FFA showed a much higher response to faces than to houses, but no preference for the configuration task over the part task. Similarly, the behavioral inversion effect was as large in the part task as the configuration task for faces, but absent in both part and configuration tasks for houses. These findings indicate that face perception mechanisms are not process specific for parts or configuration but are domain specific for face \u2026"

The present study revealed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted at the right OFA (rOFA) disrupted accurate discrimination of face parts but had no effect on the discrimination of spacing between these parts. rTMS to left OFA had no effect. A matched part and spacing discrimination task that used house stimuli showed no impairment.

Data show that the feature inversion effect varied substantially across studies as a function of the following factors: whether the feature change was shape only or included color/brightness, the number of faces in the stimulus set, and whether the feature was in facial context. For shape-only changes in facial context, feature inversion effects were as large as typical spacing inversion effects. Small feature inversion effects occurred only when a task could be efficiently solved by visual-processing areas outside whole-face coding.

As such, each of these individuals has not been sufficiently tested to provide conclusive evidence for face-specific processes. Here we make a stronger argument with a single case of severe developmental prosopagnosia by exhaustively addressing all extant alternatives.

Two prominent hypotheses have been proposed to characterize how information is represented by these special mechanisms. The spacing hypothesis suggests that face-specific mechanisms primarily extract information about spacing among parts rather than information about the shape of the parts. In contrast, the holistic hypothesis suggests that faces are processed as nondecomposable wholes and, therefore, claims that both parts and spacing among them are integral aspects of face representation. Here we examined these hypotheses by testing a group of developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) who suffer from deficits in face recognition.

(2000); Gobbini and Haxby (2007) suggests a division of labor between the fusiform face area (FFA), which processes invariant facial aspects, such as identity, and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which processes changeable facial aspects, such as expression. An extension to this model for the processing of dynamic faces proposed by O\u2019Toole et al. (2002) highlights the role of the pSTS in the processing of identity from dynamic familiar faces. To evaluate these models, we reviewed recent neuroimaging studies that examined the processing of identity and expression with static and dynamic faces. Based on accumulated data we propose an updated model, emphasizing the dissociation between form and motion as the primary functional division \u2026"

Substantial evidence indicates that this representation results from face-specific mechanisms, but some have argued that it is produced by configural mechanisms that can be applied to many objects including words. The face-specific hypothesis predicts that non-face configural processes will often be normal in prosopagnosic subjects, whereas the domain-general configural hypothesis predicts they will be deficient on all configural tasks. Although the weight of the evidence favors the face-specific hypothesis, a recent study reopened this issue when it was found that three out of five developmental prosopagnosics showed a larger local processing bias than controls in a global-local task (i.e. a Navon task). To examine this issue more thoroughly we tested a significantly larger sample of prosopagnosics (14 participants) who had \u2026"

In both humans and macaques, the network is divided into a ventral stream and a dorsal stream, and the functional similarities of the areas in humans and macaques indicate they are homologous. Neural correlates for face detection, holistic processing, face space, and other key properties of human face processing have been identified at the single neuron level, and studies providing causal evidence have established firmly that face-selective brain areas are central to face processing. These mechanisms give rise to our highly accurate familiar face recognition but also to our error-prone performance with unfamiliar faces. This limitation of the face system has important implications for consequential situations such as eyewitness identification and policing."

In 6 experiments the authors examined the influence of attentional demands, stimulus properties, and mode of response on perceptual asymmetries for global and local perception. Consistent with their theoretical predictions, asymmetries were more robust on divided-than focused-attention tasks and in response to stimuli in which local and global levels were equally salient compared with those with greater global than local saliency. Contrary to their prediction, perceptual asymmetries were not influenced by the complexity of the motor response.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The similarity between the two mechanisms likely facilitates the multi-modal integration of facial and vocal information during everyday social interactions.

Moreover, we demonstrate the in vivo correlation between the diameter of an axon and its conduction velocity in the human brain.

Here we showed that the BIE is markedly reduced for headless bodies and examined the reason for this unexpected finding. Two alternative hypotheses were examined. Either the BIE is reduced for any type of incomplete body, or the head plays a special role in discrimination of body posture. Results show that omission of other body parts (leg or arms) did not influence the magnitude of the BIE relative to complete bodies. Analogous manipulations with faces did not influence the magnitude of the face inversion effect. Importantly, similar to effects we found for headless bodies, discrimination abilities for upright bodies and the BIE were markedly reduced for \u2026"

Such patterns are determined by the type of image viewed (eg, faces, scenes) as well as the task individuals are asked to perform (eg, visual search, memory). Here we show that another key factor that significantly influences eye scanning patterns but has been mostly overlooked is the individual observer. During face viewing, we found that individuals showed diverse scanning patterns that, in many cases, were inconsistent with the typical triangular shape pattern that is commonly observed when eye scanning patterns are averaged across individuals. These idiosyncratic eye scanning patterns were not random but highly stable even when examined 18 months later. Interestingly, these eye-tracking patterns were not predictive of behavioral performance. Such stable and unique scanning patterns may represent a specific behavioral trait/signature and be formed early in development, reflecting idiosyncratic strategies for performing visual recognition tasks."

To date, person recognition has been studied primarily with static images of faces. Face recognition, however, is part of a larger system, whose preeminent goal is to efficiently recognize dynamic familiar people in unconstrained environments. We present a comprehensive framework for understanding person recognition as it happens in the real world. In this framework, dynamic information plays the central role in binding multi-modal information from the face, body, and the voice to achieve robust and highly accurate recognition. The superior temporal sulcus (STS) integrates multisensory, dynamic information from the whole person for recognition, thereby complementing its role in social cognition."

The current study tested two main hypotheses that have been suggested to explain this effect: according to the first hypothesis inverted faces lead to augmentation of activity of the same neural populations used for the processing of upright faces due to the increased processing difficulty that these stimuli impose; according to the second hypothesis the processing of inverted faces involves recruitment of additional neural mechanisms to those used for upright face processing. We employed an ERP competition paradigm in which the effect of a context stimulus on the ERP to a simultaneously presented target stimulus is measured. In Experiment 1, an upright target face was paired with an upright face, inverted face or a non-face context stimulus. ERPs time-locked to the presentation of the target showed reduced N170 \u2026"

Possible reasons include measurement error, CFMT assessment of memory only at short delays, and a face set whose ethnicity is matched to only some Caucasian groups. We develop the \u201cCFMT-Australian\u201d (CFMT-Aus), which complements the CFMT-original by using ethnicity better matched to a different European subpopulation.

It is believed that the network of face-selective areas, which spans the occipital, temporal, and frontal cortices, is important in face recognition. A number of previous studies indeed reported that face identity could be discriminated based on patterns of multivoxel activity in the fusiform face area and the anterior temporal lobe. However, given the difficulty in localizing the face-selective area in the anterior temporal lobe, its role in face recognition is still unknown. Furthermore, previous studies limited their analysis to occipito-temporal regions without testing identity decoding in more anterior face-selective regions, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. In the current high-resolution functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, we systematically examined the decoding of the identity of famous faces in the temporo-frontal network of face-selective and adjacent non-face-selective regions. A special focus has been put on the face-area in the anterior temporal lobe, which was reliably localized using an optimized scanning protocol. We found that face-identity could be discriminated above chance level only in the fusiform face area. Our results corroborate the role of the fusiform face area in face recognition. Future studies are needed to further explore the role of the more recently discovered anterior face-selective areas in face recognition."

In the current study, we applied a reverse engineering approach to reveal which facial features are critical for familiar face recognition.

Evidence for face-selective processes has also been consistently reported in cognitive studies, which investigated the face inversion effect, the composite face effect and the left visual field (LVF) superiority. These cognitive effects indicate that the perceptual representation that we generate for faces differs from the representation that is generated for inverted faces or non-face objects.

Single-cell recording studies have also reported an intermediate step of partial view invariance for mirror-symmetric face views. Nevertheless, similar evidence for this type of hierarchical processing for face view has not been reported yet in the human visual cortex. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study used state-of-the-art multivariate pattern analysis to explore face-view tuning in the human visual cortex.

During face recognition, initial fixations to the center of the nose have been taken to indicate this location is optimal for information extraction. However, the use of fixations as a marker for information use rests on the assumption that fixation patterns are predominantly determined by stimulus and task, despite the fact that fixations are also influenced by visuo-motor factors. Here, we tested the effect of starting position on fixation patterns during a face recognition task with upright and inverted faces. While we observed differences in fixations between upright and inverted faces, likely reflecting differences in cognitive processing, there was also a strong effect of start position. Over the first five saccades, fixation patterns across start positions were only coarsely similar, with most fixations around the eyes. Importantly, however, the precise fixation pattern was highly dependent on start position with a strong tendency toward facial features furthest from the start position. For example, the often-reported tendency toward the left over right eye was reversed for the left starting position. Further, delayed initial saccades for central versus peripheral start positions suggest greater information processing prior to the initial saccade, highlighting the experimental bias introduced by the commonly used center start position. Finally, the precise effect of face inversion on fixation patterns was also dependent on start position. These results demonstrate the importance of a non-stimulus, non-task factor in determining fixation patterns. The \u2026"

Most research on face processing has used a group-mean approach that averages behavioral or neural responses to faces across individuals and treats variance between individuals as noise. However, individual differences in face processing can provide valuable information that complements and extends findings from group-mean studies. Here we demonstrate that studies employing an individual differences approach\u2014examining associations and dissociations across individuals\u2014can answer fundamental questions about the way face processing operates. In particular these studies allow us to associate and dissociate the mechanisms involved in face processing, tie behavioral face processing mechanisms to neural mechanisms, link face processing to broader capacities and quantify developmental influences on face processing. The individual differences approach we illustrate here is a powerful method that should be further explored within the domain of face processing as well as fruitfully applied across the cognitive sciences."

Testing the Cambridge Face Memory Test original version (CFMT-original; European-ancestry faces from Boston USA) and a new Cambridge Face Memory Test Chinese (CFMT-Chinese), with European and Asian observers, we report a race-of-face by race-of-observer interaction that was highly significant despite modest sample size and despite observers who had quite high exposure to the other race. We attribute this to high statistical power arising from the very high internal reliability of the tasks. This power also allows us to demonstrate a much smaller within-race other ethnicity effect, based on differences in European physiognomy between Boston faces/observers and Australian faces/observers (using the CFMT-Australian)."

To answer these questions, we applied the face space framework, according to which faces are represented as points in a multidimensional feature space, such that face space distances are correlated with perceptual similarities between faces. In particular, we developed a novel method that allowed us to reveal the critical dimensions (ie, critical features) of the face space. To that end, we constructed a concrete face space, which included 20 facial features of natural face images, and asked human observers to evaluate feature values (eg, how thick are the lips). Next, we systematically and quantitatively changed facial features, and measured the perceptual effects of these manipulations. We found that critical features were those for which participants have high perceptual sensitivity (PS) for detecting differences across identities (eg, which of two faces has thicker lips). Furthermore, these high PS features vary minimally across different views of the same identity, suggesting high PS features support face recognition across different images of the same face. The methods described here set an infrastructure for discovering the critical features of other face categories not studied here (eg, Asians, familiar) as well as other aspects of face processing, such as attractiveness or trait inferences."

Accumulated evidence in recent years suggests that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), in particular face-selective region in the ATL, is a probable locus of face recognition. Unfortunately, functional MRI (fMRI) studies encounter severe signal drop-out in the ventral ATL, where that ATL face area resides. Consequently, all previous studies localized this region in no more than half of the subjects and its volume was relatively small. Thus, a systematic exploration of the properties of the ATL face area is scarce. In the current high-resolution fMRI study we used coronal slice orientation, which permitted us to localize the ATL face area in all the subjects.

However, external facial features may modify the representation of internal facial features. Here we assessed whether the representation of face identity in the fusiform face area (FFA), which has been primarily studied for internal facial features, is modified by differences in external facial features. We presented faces in which external and internal facial features were manipulated independently. Our findings show that the FFA was sensitive to differences in external facial features, but this effect was significantly larger when the external and internal features were aligned than misaligned. We conclude that the FFA generates a holistic representation in which the internal and the external facial features are integrated.

Here, we used a study\u2013test recognition task with stimuli in which the skin colour of African and Caucasian faces was manipulated to produce four categories representing the cross-section between skin colour and facial features. We show that, despite the notion that skin colour plays a major role in categorising faces into own and other-race faces, its effect on face recognition is minor relative to differences across races in facial features."

Here, we used an individual-differences approach to test whether the shape of face parts and the spacing among them are indeed processed by dissociated mechanisms. To determine whether the pattern of findings that we reveal is unique for upright faces, we also presented similarly manipulated nonface stimuli. Subjects discriminated upright or inverted faces or houses that differed in parts or spacing.

Previous studies that have addressed this question using acquired prosopagnosia are inconclusive because the non-face categories tested (e.g., cars) were not well-matched to faces in terms of visual exposure and perceptual experience. Here we compare perception of faces and bodies in four acquired prosopagnosics.

The main reason for the absence of such an investigation is that MRI data acquisition generates major artifacts, which completely conceals the EEG signal. Recently, artifact removal algorithms have been developed. Our goal was to examine the validity of the face-selective ERP component N170 and its functional effects such as category selectivity and hemispherical laterality, when recorded simultaneously with functional MRI. In our experiment, half of the scans were collected during fMRI acquisition and half without fMRI acquisition. The validity of the N170 was then measured for its amplitude, latency, face selectivity (the difference between the amplitude to faces \u2026"

The classic pattern actually reflects the average of these various idiosyncratic eye-movement patterns across individuals. The natural categories and respective frequencies of different types of idiosyncratic eye-movement patterns have not been specifically investigated before, so here we analyzed the spatial patterns of eye-movements for 48 participants to estimate the frequency of different kinds of individual eye-movement patterns to faces in the normal healthy population.

Previous electrophysiological studies found marked dissociations between recollection and familiarity, which have been widely held as corroborating the dual-process account. However, it remains unknown whether a strength interpretation can likewise apply for these findings.

The current study aimed to test the extent to which scene and object selective areas are sensitive to perceived distance information independently from their category-selectivity and retinotopic location. We conducted two studies that used a distance illusion (i.e., the Ponzo lines) and showed that scene regions (the parahippocampal place area, PPA, and transverse occipital sulcus, TOS) are biased toward perceived distal stimuli, whereas the lateral occipital (LO) object region is biased toward perceived proximal stimuli.

A second group rated the presence of a set of 12 local and global facial features. Regression analysis revealed that only the eyes or mouth significantly contributed to faceness scores. We further showed that removing eyes or mouth, but not teeth or ears, significantly reduced faceness scores.

These findings were primarily based on laboratory training protocols that dissociated exposure and individuation by using categorization tasks. However, the absence of enhanced recognition following categorization may not simulate key aspects of real-life massive exposure without individuation to other-race faces. Real-life exposure spans years of seeing a multitude of faces, under variant conditions, including expression, view, lighting and gaze, albeit with no subcategory individuation. However, in most real-life settings, massive exposure operates in concert with individuation. An exception to that are neonatology nurses, a unique population that is exposed to\u2014but do not individuate\u2014massive \u2026"

High-density EEG data were recorded from 20 healthy participants in a face recognition task and were analyzed with a focus on the face-selective N170 single-trial event-related potential. Linear discriminant analysis revealed significantly better single-trial estimation for ICA compared to raw sensor amplitudes, whereas the other two approaches did not improve classification accuracy.

Over the past four decades, much research has focused on the ORE because understanding this phenomenon is expected to elucidate fundamental face processing mechanisms and the influence of experience on such mechanisms. Several recent studies of the ORE in which the eye-movements of participants viewing own- and other-race faces were tracked have, however, reported highly conflicting results regarding the presence or absence of differential patterns of eye-movements to own- versus other-race faces. This discrepancy, of course, leads to conflicting theoretical interpretations of the perceptual basis for the ORE. Here we investigate fixation patterns to own- versus other-race (African and Chinese) faces for Caucasian participants using different analysis methods. While we detect statistically significant, though subtle, differences in fixation pattern using an Area of Interest (AOI) approach, we fail to detect significant differences when applying a spatial density map approach. Though there were no significant differences in the spatial density maps, the qualitative patterns matched the results from the AOI analyses reflecting how, in certain contexts, Area of Interest (AOI) analyses can be more sensitive in detecting the differential fixation patterns than spatial density analyses, due to spatial pooling of data with AOIs. AOI analyses, however, also come with the limitation of requiring a priori specification. These findings provide evidence that the conflicting reports in the \u2026"

These studies indicate that face recognition involves a number of separate processes, including some processes that are specialized for faces. Cognitive experiments demonstrate that faces are represented in a more holistic manner than other objects which produces precise representations of both the features and their configuration. Neurophysiological studies have revealed a number of regions in the ventral visual pathway that are preferentially activated and recent monkey work demonstrates that at least one of these areas consists entirely of face-selective neurons.

Recent studies report a second dissociation within this network such that the pSTS-FA, but not the FFA, shows much stronger response to dynamic than static faces. The aim of the current study was to test a unified model that accounts for these two functional characteristics of the neural face network.

Most studies examining the whole body in motion use point light displays, which have many advantages but are impoverished and unnatural compared to real life. To determine which factors are used when recognizing the whole person in motion we conducted two experiments using naturalistic videos. In Experiment 1 we used a matching task in which the first stimulus in each pair could either be a video or multiple still images from a video of the full body. The second stimulus, on which person recognition was performed, could be an image of either the full body or face alone. We found that the body contributed to person recognition beyond the face, but only after exposure to motion \u2026"

It is yet unknown if this affective deficiency relates to disturbed neural sensitivity to facial expressions or to overall face processing. In a previous imaging study, healthy subjects showed less suppression of the fusiform gyrus (FG) to repeated presentation of the same transfigured\u2010bizarre face relative to regular face. We assumed that the FG in schizophrenia will show reduced repetition related sensitivity to transfigured\u2010bizarre faces, while having overall normal response to faces. Methods: Ten first\u2010episode patients with schizophrenia and 10 controls rated the bizarreness of upright and inverted faces. In an fMRI study, another group of 17 first\u2010episode patients with schizophrenia and 12 controls viewed regular and transfigured\u2010bizarre faces \u2026"

In a recent review, Rossion (2008) claimed that similar inversion effects for spacing and features are due to methodological and conceptual shortcomings and that data still support the idea that inversion impairs the discrimination of features less than that of the spacing among them. Here I will claim that when facial features differ primarily in shape, the effect of inversion on features is not smaller than the one on spacing. It is when color/contrast information is added to facial features that the inversion effect on features decreases. This obvious observation accounts for the discrepancy in the literature and suggests that the large inversion effect that \u2026"

We hypothesize that this large deficit stems from the use of positional information about how the internal features are positioned relative to the external features.

However, it is still not clear if and how the representation of faces changes during the process of familiarization. In a previous study, we discovered a subset of facial features, for which we have high perceptual sensitivity (PS), that were critical for determining the identity of unfamiliar faces. This was done by assigning values to 20 different facial features based on perceptual rating, converting faces into feature-vectors, and measuring the correlations between face similarity ratings and distances between feature-vectors. In the current study, we examined the contribution of high and low-PS features to face identity after familiarization. To familiarize participants with unfamiliar faces, we used an individuation training protocol that was found to be effective in previous studies, in which different names are \u2026"

Thus, the human face processing system should be optimized for familiar face recognition. Blauch et al. (2020) used face recognition deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that are trained to maximize recognition of the trained (familiar) identities, to model human unfamiliar and familiar face recognition. In line with this model, we discuss behavioral, neuroimaging and computational findings that indicate that human face recognition develops from the generation of identity-specific concepts of familiar faces that are learned in a supervised manner, to the generation of view-invariant identity-general perceptual representations. Face-trained DCNNs seem to share some fundamental similarities with this framework."

On a general perspective, any method that measures brain function and/or structure, either performed in vivo or ex vivo, is prone to artifacts. Thus, neither of these methods owns the truth. No one can argue that histological measures of axon diameter (prone to fixation artifacts) are a true measure of in vivo axonal morphometry. At the same level, it cannot be stated that diffusion MRI, which is indirectly sensitive to axonal morphology yet suffers from technical limitations, provides absolute measure of axon diameter. In our work, we tried to highlight that our in vivo measures follow trends that were found histologically (Aboitiz et al. 1992) and also are correlated with electrophysiological measures (Marzi et al. 1991a \u2026"

The present study tested whether similarities between faces, and thus the structure of face\u2013space, were tolerant to (\u201cinvariant\u201d under) identity-preserving transformations such as changes in lighting or view. To examine the correspondence between the configurations of face\u2013space under different transformations, perceived similarity was rated for two variants of a set of faces, differing either in illumination (Experiment 1) or viewpoint (Experiment 2). We found that similarity ratings within the first variant were highly correlated with ratings within the second variant. In addition, based on these ratings, a separate face\u2013space was constructed for each variant using multidimensional scaling. Procrustean analysis revealed that the different spaces shared comparable structures. This correspondence serves as a face\u2013space manifestation of the tolerance of identity representations. Accordingly, we suggest that tolerance may rely on the fact that similarities between faces under one transformation are isomorphic to similarity patterns under a different transformation. Thus, recognizing faces under varying viewing conditions may only require similarity evaluations within\u2014rather than across\u2014different transformations."

Current neural models of face processing suggest a dissociation between the processing of invariant facial aspects such as identity and gender, that engage the fusiform face area (FFA) and the processing of changeable aspects, such as expression and eye gaze, that engage the posterior superior temporal sulcus face area (pSTS-FA). Recent studies report a second dissociation within this network such that the pSTS-FA, but not the FFA, shows much stronger response to dynamic than static faces. The aim of the current study was to test a unified model that accounts for these two major functional characteristics of the neural face network. In an fMRI experiment, we presented static and dynamic faces while subjects judged an invariant (gender) or a changeable facial aspect (expression). We found that the pSTS-FA was more engaged in processing dynamic than static faces and changeable than invariant facial aspects, whereas the OFA and FFA showed similar response across all four conditions. Our results reveal no dissociation between the processing of changeable and invariant facial aspects, but higher sensitivity to the processing of changeable facial aspects by the motion-sensitive face area in the superior temporal sulcus."

Nevertheless, in naturalistic situations we typically see the whole dynamic person, often approaching from a distance. In such cases, facial information may be less clear, and the motion pattern of an individual, their dynamic identity signature (DIS), may be used for person recognition. Recently, several studies examined the role of motion in person recognition by presenting videos of people in motion. However, such stimuli do not allow for the dissociation of gait from identity, as different individuals differ both in their gait and their identity. To examine the role of gait independently from person identity in person recognition, we used a virtual environment, which enables presenting the same type of gait across different identities. Using this setting, we assessed the accuracy and distance at which identities are recognized based on their gait, as a function of gait distinctiveness. Furthermore, the virtual environment also enabled us to assess, for the first time, the distance at which a person is recognized as a continuous variable. We find that the accuracy and distance at which people were recognized increased with gait distinctiveness. Importantly, these effects were found when recognizing identities in motion but not from static displays, indicating that DIS rather than attention, enabled more accurate person recognition. Overall these findings highlight an important role for gait in real-life person recognition and stress that gait contributes to recognition independently from the face and body."

Two factors may underlie this other-race effect: the lack of exposure to other-race faces and/or the lack of opportunity to individuate specific faces in the other-race group. Because exposure and individuation usually operate together, it is not clear which of these factors is more critical. The goal of this study was to provide a clear dissociation between these exposure and individuation in order to assess their relative roles in face recognition abilities. To that end, we assessed recognition abilities for newborn faces. Similar to other-race faces, we are hardly exposed to newborn faces and do not individuate them as we do with adult faces. Consistent with the other-race effect, adult participants showed worse performance for newborn than adult faces in a delayed match-to-sample task. To examine the role of massive \u2026"

Because humans are experts in face recognition, face-like neural and cognitive effects for objects of expertise were considered support for domain-general mechanisms. However, effects of domain, experience and level of categorization, are confounded in human studies, which may lead to erroneous inferences. To overcome these limitations, we trained deep learning algorithms on different domains (objects, faces, birds) and levels of categorization (basic, sub-ordinate, individual), matched for amount of experience. Like humans, the models generated a larger inversion effect for faces than for objects. Importantly, a face-like inversion effect was found \u2026"

The question of whether perceptual expertise is mediated by general-expert or domain-specific processing mechanisms has been hotly debated for decades in human behavioral and neuroimaging studies. To decide between these two hypotheses, most studies examined whether expertise for different domains is mediated by the same mechanisms used for faces, for which most humans are expert. Here we used deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to test whether perceptual expertise is best achieved by computations that are optimized for face or object classification. We re-trained a face-trained and an object-trained DCNNs to classify birds at the sub-ordinate or individual-level of categorization. The face-trained DCNN required deeper retraining to achieve the same level of performance for bird classification as an object-trained DCNN. These findings indicate that classification at the subordinate- or individual-level of categorization does not transfer well between domains. Thus, fine-grained classification is best achieved by using domain-specific rather than domain-general computations."

Nevertheless, humans excel in this task, in particular for faces they are familiar with. What type of learning and what is the nature of the representation of the learned identity that support such remarkable categorization ability? Here we propose that conceptual learning and the generation of a conceptual representation of the learned identity in memory enables this classification performance. First, we show that humans learn to link perceptually different faces to the same identity, if faces are learned with the same conceptual information. Next, we show that this conceptual learning does not generate a single perceptual representation of the different appearances of each identity. Instead, perceptually dissimilar images of the same identity remain separated in the perceptual space and are linked conceptually rather than perceptually. This conceptual representation of face identity is advantageous, as it enables generalization across perceptually dissimilar images of the same identity/category, without increasing false recognition of perceptually similar images of different identities. A similar conceptual mechanism may also apply to other familiar categories such as familiar voices or objects of expertise that involve fine discrimination of a homogenous sets of stimuli that are linked to unique conceptual information. Overall these findings highlight the importance of studying the contribution of both cognition and perception to face recognition."

On a cued bilateral task, participants tried to identify a syllable in the attended visual field, which elicits a left hemisphere (LH) advantage and different processing strategies by the two hemispheres. The same or a different syllable or a neutral stimulus appeared in the unattended field. Transmission of unattended syllable codes between hemispheres is symmetric, as revealed by equal interference for the two visual fields. The LH is more accurate than the RH in encoding unattended syllables, as indicated by facilitation in the left but not right visual field and a greater frequency of identifiable intrusions into the left than right field. However, asymmetric encoding strategies are different for attended and unattended syllables."

A main limitation of these studies is that human experience with faces is more extensive than with any object of expertise. Current computational models of object recognition enable us now to re-evaluate this question with models that are matched for the amount of experience with different categories of expertise.

Because humans are face experts, face-like effects in objects of expertise were considered support for the general-expertise hypothesis. Conversely, stronger effects for faces, were considered support for the domain-specific hypothesis. However, effects of domain, experience, and level of categorization, are confounded in human studies, which may lead to erroneous inferences. To overcome these limitations, we used computational models of perceptual expertise and tested different domains and levels of categorization in isolation, matched for amount of experience. Like humans, the models generated a larger inversion effect for faces than for objects. Importantly, a face-like inversion effect was found for individual-based categorization of non-faces but only in a network specialized for that domain. Thus, contrary to prevalent assumptions, face-like effects in objects of expertise may originate from domain-specific rather than general-expert processing mechanisms."

Particularly, randomly selected test images are more likely to be perceptually similar to learned high variability images, and dissimilar to learned low variability images. Here we dissociated effects of learning from variability and study-test perceptual similarity, by collecting human similarity ratings for the study and test images.

However, two critical aspects of human face recognition are overlooked by these networks. First, human face recognition is mostly concerned with familiar faces, which are encoded by visual and semantic information, while current DNNs solely rely on visual information. Second, humans represent familiar faces in memory, but representational similarities with DNNs were only investigated for human perception. To address this gap, we combined visual (VGG-16), visual-semantic (CLIP), and natural language processing (NLP) DNNs to predict human representations of familiar faces in perception and memory. The visual-semantic network substantially improved predictions beyond the visual network, revealing a new visual-semantic representation in human perception and memory. The NLP network further improved predictions of human representations in memory. Thus, a complete account of human face recognition should go beyond vision and incorporate visual-semantic, and semantic representations."

Body motion has been shown to contribute to person recognition especially when facial information is unclear. Additionally, generating whole person context, by attaching faceless heads to bodies, has been shown to activate face processing mechanisms and may therefore enhance body-based person recognition.

Nonetheless, this remarkable ability is limited to familiar faces and does not generalize to unfamiliar faces. To account for humans superior ability to recognize familiar faces, current theories suggest that familiar and unfamiliar faces have different perceptual representations. In the current study, we applied a reverse engineering approach to reveal which facial features are critical for familiar face recognition. In contrast to current views, we discovered that the same subset of features that are used for matching unfamiliar faces, are also used for matching as well as recognition of familiar faces. We further show that these features are also used by a deep neural network face recognition algorithm. We therefore propose a new framework that assumes similar perceptual representation for all faces, and integrates cognition and perception to account for humans superior recognition of familiar faces."

Here we present a\" reverse engineering\" approach to this problem: testing which features should be changed such that a modified face is no longer recognized as the original person. Based on the Face-Space theory (Valentine, 1989), we constructed a multidimensional feature space, wherein each dimension is a different feature and each face is represented as a feature vector. To do this, we defined a set of 20 features (eg eyebrow thickness, skin texture, lip thickness etc.) and asked subjects to assign values to these features for each face (eg, rate eyebrow thickness on a\" very narrow-very thick\" scale). To modify faces, the distinctive (ie far from average) features in each face were replaced, by copying features with\" opposite\" values, from other faces in the data-set.

Given the central role the head plays in the behavioral body inversion effect, here we asked whether the body inversion effect is mediated by face-selective or body-selective brain areas. In two event-related fMR-adaptation experiments, we measured the response of category-selective occipito-temporal areas to pairs of upright or inverted bodies that were either same or different in posture. The first experiment presented whole bodies, while the second used headless bodies. For all body stimuli internal facial features were covered with a gray ellipsoid. Body-selective areas \u2026"

Subjects were presented with a sequential matching task of bodies that were either identical or differ in position of the head, leg and hand. Our results show reduced performance and no inversion effect for headless bodies relative to complete bodies. In contrast, performance level and the magnitude of the inversion effect for bodies without hands or a leg were similar to complete bodies.

Our recent studies show that conceptual/social information contributes to face recognition in two ways: First, faces that are learned in social context are better recognized than faces that are learned based on their perceptual appearance.

Faces are known to engage specialized mechanisms and it is therefore of interest to reveal to what extent is specific experience with faces necessary for the development of this representation. This question is hard to study in humans, but can be studied with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DNNs) trained with faces or with objects. To examine whether a face-trained and an object-trained networks generate a human-like, view-invariant representation, we first examined the similarity between the representations of faces across different head views. We then examined whether the networks use the same viewinvariant facial features that are used by humans for face recognition. Our findings show that a human-like viewinvariant representation of faces emerges at higher layers of a face-trained DNN, but not the object-trained DNN. The representations of faces were similar at lower layers of the face-trained and object-trained networks. These findings may resemble the face and object pathways in the human brain that are similar in low-level areas and diverge at higher levels of the visual cortex. They further imply that invariant face recognition depends on experience with faces, during which the system learns to extract face-specific, invariant features."

To answer these questions, we applied the face space framework, according to which faces are represented as points in a multidimensional feature space, such that face space distances are correlated with perceptual similarities between faces. In particular, we developed a novel method that allowed us to reveal the critical dimensions (ie, critical features) of the face space. To that end, we constructed a concrete face space, which included 20 facial features of natural face images, and asked human observers to evaluate feature values (eg, how thick are the lips). Next, we systematically and quantitatively changed facial features, and measured the perceptual effects of these manipulations. We found that critical features were those for which \u2026"

However, recent studies have highlighted the role of individuation in better recognition of own versus other race faces. In this study we therefore examined the role of perceptual exposure and individuation in familiar face recognition. An old-new face recognition task was used in order to assess the sole contribution of each of these factors to the learning of unfamiliar faces: rich perceptual information (viewing a face in different angles and illuminations), simple individuation (association of a face with an uninformative but unique label) and association of a face with person-related semantic information, such as a name or an occupation.

In particular, if a stimulus is visually perceived as a face and exclusively activates face-selective neural and cognitive mechanisms, then our mind considers it a face. Recent evidence suggests that based on this approach, faceless heads in body context, which do not include internal facial features should be considered faces as they generate the most established face-specific markers.

While KH was impaired with faces across all tasks, her performance with bodies was well-within the normal range, except for attractiveness rating.

However, an objective evaluation of different approaches is lacking. The present study therefore compared four frequently-used single-trial data filtering procedures: raw sensor amplitudes, regression-based estimation, bandpass filtering, and independent component analysis (ICA). High-density EEG data were recorded from 20 healthy participants in a face recognition task and were analyzed with a focus on the face-selective N170 single-trial event-related potential. Linear discriminant analysis revealed significantly better single-trial estimation for ICA compared to raw sensor amplitudes, whereas the other two approaches did not improve classification accuracy. Further analyses suggested that ICA enabled extraction of a face-sensitive independent component in each participant, which led to the superior performance in single trial estimation. Additionally, we show that the face-sensitive component does not directly represent activity from a neuronal population exclusively involved in face-processing, but rather the activity of a network involved in general visual processing. We conclude that ICA effectively facilitates the separation of physiological trial-by-trial fluctuations from measurement noise, in particular when the process of interest is reliably reflected in components representing the neural signature of interest."

This result has important implications for the nature of configural information that participates in recognition. Although there is currently no precise definition of \u2018facial configuration\u2019, it is implicitly assumed that its primary constituents are the mutual spatial relationships of the internal features (eyes, nose and mouth).

However, to date no evidence for such representation has been shown in the human brain.

If the assumption is true, then the fixation location at stimulus onset should not largely influence subsequent fixation patterns. However, we demonstrate that start location very strongly affects subsequent fixation patterns. Participants viewed upright and inverted faces and were told that they would be required to recognize the faces later in the experiment. We imposed five different start locations relative to the faces: above, below, right, left, and center (tip of nose). We found a distinct pattern of fixations for each start location that extended through at least the first five fixations. In particular, there was a strong fixation bias \u2026"

External information is usually excluded in most face studies, but it may have a significant influence on the representation of the internal face features. In our study we presented pairs of faces of same or different identity in three different variations: in a cap condition faces wear a cap that covers their hair, in the hair (no-cap) condition the hair is shown and in a cap-hair condition one face had a cap on and the other did not.

This configural processing could be the product of a face-specific mechanism or a content-general configural processing mechanism. If they are content-general, prosopagnosics (individuals with impaired face recognition) should show impairments with a wide range of tasks involving configural processing. To determine whether our sample of prosopagnosics have problems with face configural processing, they were tested with a task requiring discrimination between faces that differed in either part configuration or the face parts themselves. The prosopagnosics showed deficits with face configuration discriminations but also showed comparable deficits with face part discriminations. We then assessed non-face configural processing using three independent measures. On a task with houses that was parallel to that used with faces, the \u2026"

After posing for a photograph preceded by red eye reduction flashes and the normal flash, LJ became disoriented and sounds were distorted. His disorientation and hearing difficulty cleared up within a matter of minutes, but his face perception has been severely impaired ever since. In the preceding years, he suffered from several spells of disorientation, including one following exposure to a strobing light. Other than face perception, LJ is unaware of any difficulties resulting from the incident. He reads and plays the piano normally. LJ is a world-class juggler, and his juggling has not suffered. He reports no difficulties with object recognition in daily life, and he has performed normally on a wide range of object tests.

This enables us now to ask whether DCNNs rely on the same facial information and whether this human-like representation depends on a system that is optimized for face identification. In the current study, we examined the representation of DCNNs of faces that differ in features that are critical or non-critical for human face recognition.

Nevertheless, little is known on whether person recognition can be performed based on the body alone. In this study, we examined two sources of information that may enhance body-based person recognition: body motion and whole person context. Body motion has been shown to contribute to person recognition especially when facial information is unclear. Additionally, generating whole person context, by attaching faceless heads to bodies, has been shown to activate face processing mechanisms and may therefore enhance body-based person recognition. To assess body-based person recognition, participants performed a sequential matching task in which they studied a video of a person walking followed by a headless image of the same or different identity. The role of body motion was examined by comparing recognition from dynamic vs. static headless bodies. The role of whole person context was examined by comparing bodies with and without faceless heads. Our findings show that person recognition from the body alone was better in dynamic vs. static displays indicating that body motion contributed to body-based person recognition. In addition, whole person context contributed to body-based person recognition when recognition was performed in static displays. Overall these findings show that recognizing people based on their body alone is challenging but can be performed under certain circumstances that enhance the processing of the body when \u2026"

Nonhuman animals also show great sensitivity to facial information (Sackett, GP, 1966; Burghardt, G., 1990; Waitt, C. et al., 2003), and natural selection has had eons to sculpt human face-processing abilities.

Func-46 tional MRI studies have revealed regions in the occipital\u2013temporal 47 cortex that show a much higher response for faces than objects 48 (Kanwisher et al., 1997; McCarthy et al., 1997; for review see 49 Kanwisher and Yovel (2006)). These findings from human neuro-50 imaging are consistent with single cell recording studies with 51 monkeys, which have reported neurons in the inferior temporal 52 cortex and superior temporal sulcus that show a highly face-53 selective response (Desimone et al., 1984 \u2026"

            "abstract": "It is well established that scenes and objects elicit a highly selective response in specific brain regions in the ventral visual cortex. An inherent difference between these categories that has not been explored yet is their perceived distance from the observer (ie scenes are distal whereas objects are proximal). The current study aimed to test the extent to which scene and object selective areas are sensitive to perceived distance information independently from their category-selectivity and retinotopic location. We conducted two studies that used a distance illusion (ie, the Ponzo lines) and showed that scene regions (the parahippocampal place area, PPA, and transverse occipital sulcus, TOS) are biased toward perceived distal stimuli, whereas the lateral occipital (LO) object region is biased toward perceived proximal stimuli. These results suggest that the ventral visual cortex plays a role in representing distance information, extending recent findings on the sensitivity of these regions to location information. More broadly, our findings imply that distance information is inherent to object recognition."

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a face-matching task for four types of centrally presented faces: Bisymmetric faces, comprised of a person's hemiface and its mirror image; Chimeric faces, which joined the hemifaces of two different people; and two types of Hemifaces, in which a person's half-face to the right or left was joined to a low-contrast, standard half-face in the opposite visual field. The faces were presented in randomized order for 45 ms followed by a pattern mask. A white stripe along the vertical midline of all faces concealed the discrepancy between the two halves, such that subjects were unaware that some faces were not bilaterally symmetric. Despite a higher level of performance for Hemi-left than Hemi-right faces and higher frequency of left than right hemispatial matches for Chimeric faces, ERPs \u2026"
