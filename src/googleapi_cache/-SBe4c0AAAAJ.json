Facial information is extracted within visual cortex by a network of interlinked face-selective areas, each with unique functional properties. Neurons within face areas exhibit central properties of face perception like face detection by coarse facial features, holistic processing, or generation of a physical face space, and their activity has been causally linked to face perception. Some face cells combine selectivity for faces with non-visual information like familiarity. At the intersection of high-level vision and social cognition, the domain of face-processing has proven fertile ground for uncovering principles of complex information processing."

            "abstract": "Visual experience is known to play a critical role in face recognition. This experience is believed to enable the formation of a view-invariant representation, by learning which features are critical for face identification across views. Discovering these critical features and the type of experience that is needed to uncover them is challenging. A recent study revealed a subset of facial features that are critical for human face recognition. Furthermore, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that are trained on face classification, but not on object categorization, were sensitive to these facial features, highlighting the importance of experience with faces for the system to reveal these critical features. These findings enable us now to ask what type of experience with faces is required for the network to become sensitive to these human-like critical features and whether it is associated with the formation of a view-invariant representation and face classification performance. To that end, we systematically manipulated the number of within-identity and between-identity face images and examined its effect on the network performance on face classification, view-invariant representation, and sensitivity to human-like critical facial features. Results show that increasing the number of images per identity as well as the number of identities were both required for the simultaneous development of a view-invariant representation, sensitivity to human-like critical features, and successful identity classification. The concurrent emergence of sensitivity to critical features, view invariance and classification performance through experience implies that they depend on similar \u2026"

Its significance extends to fundamental issues of functional localization and global theories of consciousness. Here we addressed this question by comparing potential parallels between the relational structure of prefrontal visual activations and visual and textual-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). The frontal visual relational structures were revealed in intra-cranial recordings of human patients, conducted for clinical purposes, while the patients viewed familiar images of faces and places. Our results reveal that visual relational structures in frontal cortex were, surprisingly, predicted by text and not visual DNNs. Importantly, the temporal dynamics of these correlations showed striking differences, with a rapid decline over time for the visual component, but persistent dynamics including a significant image offset response for the text component. The results point to a dynamic text-related function of visual prefrontal responses in the human brain."

This question has generated a fierce debate in the study of expert object recognition. Because humans are experts in face recognition, face-like neural and cognitive effects for objects of expertise were considered support for domain-general mechanisms. However, effects of domain, experience and level of categorization, are confounded in human studies, which may lead to erroneous inferences. To overcome these limitations, we trained deep learning algorithms on different domains (objects, faces, birds) and levels of categorization (basic, sub-ordinate, individual), matched for amount of experience. Like humans, the models generated a larger inversion effect for faces than for objects. Importantly, a face-like inversion effect was found \u2026"
