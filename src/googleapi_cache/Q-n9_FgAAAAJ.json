            "abstract": "Despite decades of study of memory, it remains unclear what makes an image memorable. There is considerable debate surrounding the underlying determinants of memory, including the roles of semantic (e.g., animacy, utility) and visual features (e.g., brightness) as well as whether the most prototypical or most atypical items are best remembered. Prior studies have relied on constrained stimulus sets, limiting any generalized view of the features that may contribute to memory. Here, we collected over one million memory ratings (N=13,946) for THINGS , a naturalistic dataset of 26,107 object images designed to comprehensively sample concrete objects. First, we establish a model of object features that is predictive of image memorability, capturing over half of the explainable variance. For this model, we find that semantic features have a stronger influence than visual features on what people will remember. Second, we examined whether memorability could be accounted for by the typicality of the objects, by comparing human behavioral data, object feature dimensions, and deep neural network features. While prototypical objects tend to be the most memorable, the relationship between memorability and typicality is more complex than a simple positive or negative association and typicality alone cannot account for memorability.Why is it that we seem to remember and forget the same things? Our lived experiences differ, but there is remarkable consistency in what is remembered across people. Here, we collected memory performance scores for a comprehensive and diverse collection of natural object images to \u2026"

Here, we present THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale neuroimaging and behavioral datasets in humans, comprising densely sampled functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of photographic images for up to 1,854 object concepts. THINGS-data is unique in its breadth of richly annotated objects, allowing for testing countless hypotheses at scale while assessing the reproducibility of previous findings. Beyond the unique insights promised by each individual dataset, the multimodality of THINGS-data allows combining datasets for a much broader view into object processing than previously possible. Our analyses demonstrate the high quality of the datasets and provide five examples of hypothesisdriven and data-driven applications. THINGS-data constitutes the core public release of the THINGS initiative (https://things-initiative. org) for bridging the gap between disciplines and the advancement of cognitive neuroscience."

This requires that we flexibly integrate and focus on different object properties to support specific behavioral goals. In the current study, we examined how these rich object representations unfold in the human brain by modelling time-resolved MEG signals evoked by viewing thousands of objects. Using millions of behavioral judgments to guide our understanding of the neural representation of the object space, we find distinct temporal profiles across the object dimensions. These profiles fell into two broad types with either a distinct and early peak (~150 ms) or a slow rise to a late peak (~300 ms). Further, the early effects are stable across participants in contrast to later effects which show more variability across people. This highlights that early peaks may carry stimulus-specific and later peaks subject-specific information. Given that the dimensions with early peaks seem to be primarily visual dimensions and those with later peaks more conceptual, our results suggest that conceptual processing is more variable across people. Together, these data provide a comprehensive account of how a variety of object properties unfold in the human brain and contribute to the rich nature of object vision."

However, given the factorial design in the original studies, it has remained open to what degree these findings generalize to larger stimulus sets.

At the same time, previous research has shown that FFA activity overlaps with several other feature maps that are not face specific, such as animacy, size, or curvature (Long et al., 2017), and FFA has been shown to carry above-chance information about non-face objects (Duchaine & Yovel, 2015).

While there has been substantial progress in understanding how scene information is represented in the brain, it remains unknown to what extent particular scene representations are relevant for decision behavior. To address this question, we recorded fMRI data while human participants (N= 29) viewed manmade and natural scenes and paired it with behavioral data recorded in a separate session from participants (N= 30) performing either a categorization task or an orthogonal task on the same stimuli. In order to identify behaviorally relevant information, we correlated the reaction times (RTs) of individual scenes with the distances of scene-specific fMRI responses to a hyperplane derived from a multivariate pattern classifier. Our findings are threefold. First, we found negative distance-RT correlations for the categorization task in \u2026"

At this rate, the BOLD signal is expected to be linear and can therefore be analyzed in a linear modeling framework. However, this assumption conflicts with recent findings that have successfully mapped the content of video stimuli to brain responses and with other work using more rapidly changing stimuli, suggesting that higher presentation rates may be possible. To address these seemingly conflicting views, we used simulations and measured brain responses with 7 Tesla fMRI (TR= 500ms) to determine the extent to which rapid stimulus presentation is achievable. For fMRI, we varied presentation rates between 0.5 s and 4s and presented observers with images of faces, places, objects, and scrambled objects. Our simulations showed that \u2026"

To address this question, we collected intuitive similarity judgments across two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos depicting everyday actions. We used cross-validated sparse non-negative matrix factorization to identify the structure underlying action similarity judgments. A low-dimensional representation, consisting of nine to ten dimensions, was sufficient to accurately reconstruct human similarity judgments. The dimensions were robust to stimulus set perturbations and reproducible in a separate odd-one-out experiment.

Here we present a dataset probing semantic knowledge with a three-terms semantic associative task: which of two target words is more closely associated with a given anchor (e.g., is lemon closer to squeezer or sour?). The dataset includes both abstract and concrete nouns for a total of 10,107 triplets.

Recent interpretability methods have focused primarily on understanding the contribution of individual features or image regions to classification performance, but have placed less emphasis on the larger set of representational motifs that are being learned by predictive models. In this talk, I will highlight recent work from our own group aimed at revealing interpretable object representations from human behavior, patterns of brain activity, and artificial neural networks. Our approach operates at the level of triplet similarities and yields low-dimensional human interpretable embeddings with excellent reconstruction accuracy, providing both perceptual as well as semantic representational dimensions.

Despite substantial progress in the understanding of the neural representations underlying scene recognition, it remains unknown how these representations translate into behavior given different task demands. To address this, we aimed to identify behaviorally relevant scene representations, to characterize them in terms of their underlying visual features, and to reveal how they vary given different tasks. We recorded fMRI data while human participants viewed manmade and natural scenes and linked brain responses to behavior in one of two tasks acquired in a separate set of subjects: a manmade/natural categorization task or an orthogonal task on fixation. First, we found correlations between scene categorization response times (RTs) and scene-specific brain responses, quantified as the distance to a hyperplane derived from a multivariate classifier, in occipital and ventral-temporal, but not parahippocampal cortex. This suggests that representations in early visual and object-selective cortex are relevant for scene categorization. Next, we revealed that mid-level visual features, as quantified using deep convolutional neural networks, best explained the relationship between scene representations and behavior, indicating that these features are read out in scene categorization. Finally, we observed opposite patterns of correlations between brain responses and RTs in the categorization and orthogonal task, suggesting a critical influence of task on the behavioral relevance of scene representations. Together, these results reveal the \u2026"
