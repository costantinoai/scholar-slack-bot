As a group, patients with left dorsal striatal damage (our patients of interest) showed higher activation than neurotypical controls in the left superior parietal cortex during successful speech production.

We demonstrate that our model provides the greatest compromise in three factors: performance competitive with the state-of-the-art; parameter efficiency of a CNN; and the favourable inductive biases of a transformer.

Integrating previous research on auditory information processing and the impact of bi- and multilingualism on brain structure, we investigate how the morphology of auditory brain regions reflects individuals\u2019 language experience and, more specifically, their phonological repertoire. Leveraging two distinct samples comprising over 200 participants, each exposed to between 1 and 7 languages encompassing 36 different languages, we explore whether the morphological variability of auditory brain regions reflects individual language experience, specifically focusing on the phonological repertoire. Additionally, we examine the potential influence of typological distances between languages spoken by multilingual individuals on the neural signatures of multilingualism within the auditory cortex. Our findings revealed a relationship between the average thickness of the left and right second transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) and participants\u2019 language experience. Model comparisons demonstrated that the inclusion of phoneme-level information in the language experience index accounted for the greatest variance in average TTG thickness (bilaterally). The direction of this effect was negative, indicating that a more extensive and more phonologically diverse language experience was associated with thinner cortices in the second TTG. Across two independent datasets, we provide robust evidence linking the degree of language experience and typological distance \u2026"

The novel contributions are three-fold. We first define and inter-relate five neurobiological and five methodological constraints that need to be accounted for when interpreting lesion-symptom associations and generating synthetic lesion data. The first implication is that, because of these constraints, lesion-symptom mapping needs to focus on probabilistic relationships between Lesion and Symptom, with Lesion as a multivariate spatial pattern, Symptom as a time-dependent behavioral profile and evidence that Lesion raises the probability of Symptom. The second implication is that in order to assess the strength of probabilistic causality, we need to distinguish between causal lesion sites, incidental lesion sites, spared but dysfunctional sites, and intact \u2026"
