            "abstract": "We use visual information to build up complex and meaningful mental models of ourselves and our environments. However, it is largely unknown how expectations derived from these complex mental models influence eye movements. To address this question we here recorded gaze behaviour of adult human volunteers as they were watching picture stories. These were presented either in a meaningful order, or a scrambled order. Each story was presented repeatedly, allowing to assess how narrative knowledge influences subsequent visual sampling. We tested how a state-of-the-art model of gaze behaviour based on visual saliency, DeepGaze II, accounts for the observed gaze behaviour. Our preliminary results indicate that the model captures gaze behaviour better when images are presented in a scrambled than intact order, and during first rather than subsequent viewing. This suggests that as one acquires expectations about the narrative, either from world knowledge or from previous experience, sampling behaviour starts to deviate from what can be predicted based on a visual saliency model. We speculate that this is caused by a shift towards information sampling based on meaning-based expectations. We are currently testing this hypothesis by quantifying meaning-based expectations in stories using language modelling (GPT-2)."

            "abstract": "The relationship between conscious experience and brain activity has intrigued scientists and philosophers for centuries. In the last decades, several theories have suggested different accounts for these relationships. These theories have developed in parallel, with little to no cross-talk among them. To advance research on consciousness, we established an adversarial collaboration between proponents of two of the major theories in the field, Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory. Together, we devised and preregistered two experiments that test contrasting predictions of these theories concerning the location and timing of correlates of visual consciousness, which have been endorsed by the theories\u2019 proponents. Predicted outcomes should either support, refute, or challenge these theories. Six theory-impartial laboratories will follow the study protocol specified here, using three complementary methods: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magneto-Electroencephalography (M-EEG), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The study protocol will include built-in replications, both between labs and within datasets. Through this ambitious undertaking, we hope to provide decisive evidence in favor or against the two theories and clarify the footprints of conscious visual perception in the human brain, while also providing an innovative model of large-scale, collaborative, and open science practice."

            "abstract": "Human agents build models of their environment, which enable them to anticipate and plan upcoming events. However, little is known about the properties of such predictive models. Recently, it has been proposed that hippocampal representations take the form of a predictive maplike structure, the so-called successor representation (SR). Here, we used human functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe whether activity in the early visual cortex (V1) and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties of the SR after visual sequence learning. Participants were exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal sequence consisting of four items (A-B-C-D). We found that after repeated exposure to the sequence, merely presenting single sequence items (eg,-B--) resulted in V1 activation at the successor locations of the full sequence (eg, C-D), but not at the predecessor locations (eg, A). This highlights that visual representations are skewed toward future states, in line with the SR. Similar results were also found in the hippocampus. Moreover, the hippocampus developed a coactivation profile that showed sensitivity to the temporal distance in sequence space, with fading representations for sequence events in the more distant past and future. V1, in contrast, showed a coactivation profile that was only sensitive to spatial distance in stimulus space. Taken together, these results provide empirical evidence for the proposition that both visual and hippocampal cortex represent a predictive map of the visual world akin to the SR."

These theories have independently accrued evidence, yet, confirmation bias and dependence on design choices hamper progress in the field. Here, we present an open science adversarial collaboration which directly juxtaposes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), employing a theory-neutral consortium approach. We investigate neural correlates of the content and duration of visual experience. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes, and their interpretation. 256 human subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electrocorticography. We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex. Beyond challenging the theories themselves, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive \u2026"

Despite this complexity, we recognize scenes, and objects within these scenes, from a brief glance at an image. In this review, we synthesize recent behavioral and neural findings that elucidate the mechanisms underlying this impressive ability. First, we review evidence that visual object and scene processing is partly implemented in parallel, allowing for a rapid initial gist of both objects and scenes concurrently. Next, we discuss recent evidence for bidirectional interactions between object and scene processing, with scene information modulating the visual processing of objects, and object information modulating the visual processing of scenes. Finally, we review evidence that objects also combine with each other to form object constellations, modulating the processing of individual objects within the object pathway. Altogether, these findings can be understood by conceptualizing object and scene perception as the outcome of a joint probabilistic inference, in which \u201cbest guesses\u201d about objects act as priors for scene perception and vice versa, in order to concurrently optimize visual inference of objects and scenes."

            "abstract": "Our perception does not depend exclusively on the immediate sensory input. It is also influenced by our internal predictions derived from prior observations and the temporal regularities of the environment, which can result in choice history biases. However, the mechanisms facilitating this flexible use of prior information to predict the future are unclear. Prior information may offset evidence accumulation independently of the current sensory input, or it may modulate the weight of current sensory input based on its consistency with the expectation. To address this question, we used a visual decision-making task and manipulated the transitional probabilities between successive noisy grating stimuli. Using a reverse correlation analysis, we evaluated the contribution of stimulus-independent bias and stimulus-dependent sensitivity modulations to choice history biases. We found that both mechanisms coexist, whereby there was increased bias to respond in line with the predicted orientation alongside modulations in perceptual sensitivity to favour perceptual information consistent with the prediction, akin to selective attention. Furthermore, at the individual differences level, we investigated the relationship between autistic-like traits and the adaptation of choice history biases to the sequential statistics of the environment. Over two studies, we found no convincing evidence of reduced adaptation to sequential regularities in individuals with high autistic-like traits. In sum, we present robust evidence for both perceptual confirmation bias and decision bias supporting adaptation to sequential regularities in the environment."

Specifically, we examined whether the human brain anticipates each object in a scene individually or anticipates the scene as a whole. To explore this issue, we first trained participants to associate co-occurring objects within fixed spatial arrangements. Meanwhile, participants implicitly learned temporal regularities between these displays. We then tested how spatial and temporal violations of the structure modulated behavior and neural activity in the visual system using fMRI.

We present the results of a collaborative project assessing the correspondence between curiosity measures in personality psychology and cognitive science. 820 participants completed 15 personality trait measures and 9 cognitive tasks that tested multiple aspects of information demand. Shared variance across the cognitive tasks was captured by a dimension reflecting directed (uncertainty-driven) versus random (stochasticity-driven) exploration. Individual differences along this axis were significantly and consistently predicted by personality traits. However, the personality predictors were not the core elements of trait curiosity, but instead included stress tolerance, thrill seeking, extraversion, need for cognition, and behavioral inhibition. The results inform our emerging understanding of curiosity and suggest that indices of curiosity in cognitive tasks are not isomorphic with common measures of curiosity in personality psychology."

We find information about conscious content in visual, ventro-temporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results confirm some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging both theories: for IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in prefrontal cortex.

            "abstract": "Perception and behaviour are significantly moulded by expectations derived from our prior knowledge. Hierarchical predictive processing theories provide a principled account of the neural mechanisms underpinning these processes, casting perception as a hierarchical inference process. While numerous studies have shown stronger neural activity for surprising inputs, in line with this account, it is unclear what predictions are made across the cortical hierarchy, and therefore what kind of surprise drives this upregulation of activity. Here we leveraged fMRI and visual dissimilarity metrics derived from a deep neural network to arbitrate between two hypotheses: prediction errors may signal a local mismatch between input and expectation at each level of the cortical hierarchy, or prediction errors may incorporate feedback signals and thereby inherit complex tuning properties from higher areas. Our results are in line with this second hypothesis. Prediction errors in both low- and high-level visual cortex primarily scaled with high-level, but not low-level, visual surprise. This scaling with high-level surprise in early visual cortex strongly diverges from feedforward tuning, indicating a shift induced by predictive contexts. Mechanistically, our results suggest that high-level predictions may help constrain perceptual interpretations in earlier areas thereby aiding perceptual inference. Combined, our results elucidate the feature tuning of visual prediction errors and bolster a core hypothesis of hierarchical predictive processing theories, that predictions are relayed top-down to facilitate perception."

Within visual search, contextual cueing demonstrates how implicit knowledge of scenes can improve search performance. This is commonly interpreted as spatial context in the scenes becoming predictive of the target location, which leads to a more efficient guidance of attention during search. However, what drives this enhanced guidance is unknown. First, it is unclear whether improved attentional guidance is enabled by target enhancement or distractor suppression. Second, it is unknown whether the entire scene (global context) or more local drives this phenomenon. In the present MEG experiment, we leveraged Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) to answer these two outstanding questions. We found that the improved performance when searching implicitly familiar scenes was accompanied by a stronger neural representation of the target stimulus, at the cost specifically of those distractors directly surrounding the target. Crucially, this biasing of local attentional competition was behaviorally relevant when searching familiar scenes, indicating that it is the local, and not global, spatial context that is modulated, culminating in a search advantage for familiar scenes. Taken together, we conclude that implicitly learned spatial predictive context improves how we search our environment by sharpening the attentional field."

Under this hypothesis, prior exposure to a stimulus should lead to a weaker or absent alteration of the behavioral and neural response to the stimulus in autism, compared to a typical population. To examine this hypothesis, we recruited two samples of human volunteers: a student sample (N=26), which we used to establish our analysis pipeline, and an adolescent sample (N=36), which consisted of a group of autistic (N=18) and a group of non-autistic (N=18) participants. All participants were presented with visual stimulus streams consisting of novel and familiar image pairs, while they attentively monitored each stream. We recorded task performance and used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure neural responses, and to compare the responses to familiar and novel images. We found behavioral facilitation as well as a reduction of event-related field (ERF) amplitude for familiar, compared to novel, images in both samples. Crucially, we found statistical evidence against between-group effects of familiarity on both behavioral and neural responses in the adolescent sample, suggesting that the influence of familiarity is comparable between autistic and non-autistic adolescents. These findings challenge the notion that perception in autism is marked by a reduced influence of prior exposure."
