Block\u2019s landmark book, The Border Between Seeing and Thinking, investigates the nature of perception, how perception differs from cognition and why the distinction matters.

Here, we explore a central project of the book\u2013Block\u2019s attempts to identify the features of perception that distinguish it from higher level cognition\u2013by focusing on his suggestion that such features closely relate to perception\u2019s purpose.

While this question is at the center of a rich and divided philosophical tradition (with some scholars answering affirmatively and some negatively), Morales et al.(2020, 2021) took an empirical approach, reporting 10 experiments whose results favor such perspectival similarity. Recently, Burge and Burge (2022) offered a vigorous critique of this work, objecting to its approach and conclusions on both philosophical and empirical grounds. Here, we answer these objections on both fronts. We show that Burge and Burge\u2019s critique rests on misunderstandings of Morales et al.\u2019s claims; of the relation between the data and conclusions; and of the philosophical context in which the work appears. Specifically, Burge and Burge attribute to us a much stronger (and stranger) view than we hold, involving the introduction of \u201ca new \u2026"

Although this question is at the center of scientific research on perception, it has also long been explored by philosophers, who ask fundamental questions about our capacity to perceive: Do our different senses represent the world in commensurable ways? How much of our environment are we aware of at one time? Which aspects of perception are \u201cobjective\u201d and which \u201csubjective\u201d? What properties count as perceptual in the first place? Although these parallel research programs typically proceed independently in contemporary scholarship, previous eras recognized more active collaboration across philosophical and scientific approaches to perception. Here, we review an emerging research focus that aims to reunite these approaches by putting long-standing philosophical questions to empirical test \u2026"

However, daily life also seems to present us with experiences characterized by the absence of sound\u2014a moment of silence, a gap between thunderclaps, the hush after a musical performance. In these cases, do we positively hear silence? Or do we just fail to hear, and merely judge or infer that it is silent? This longstanding question remains controversial in both the philosophy and science of perception, with prominent theories holding that sounds are the only objects of auditory experience and thus that our encounter with silence is cognitive, not perceptual. However, this debate has largely remained theoretical, without a key empirical test. Here, we introduce an empirical approach to this theoretical dispute, presenting experimental evidence that silence can be genuinely perceived (not just \u2026"

However, their success is accompanied by a striking failure: a tendency to commit bizarre misclassifications on inputs specifically selected to fool them. What do ordinary people know about the nature and prevalence of such classification errors? Here, five experiments exploit the recent discovery of \u201cnatural adversarial examples\u201d to ask whether naive observers can predict when and how machines will misclassify natural images. Whereas classical adversarial examples are inputs that have been minimally perturbed to induce misclassifications, natural adversarial examples are simply unmodified natural photographs that consistently fool a wide variety of machine recognition systems. For example, a bird casting a shadow might be misclassified as a sundial, or a beach umbrella made of straw might be misclassified as a broom. In Experiment 1, subjects accurately predicted which natural images machines would misclassify and which they would not. Experiments 2 through 4 extended this ability to how the images would be misclassified, showing that anticipating machine misclassifications goes beyond merely identifying an image as nonprototypical. Finally, Experiment 5 replicated these findings under more ecologically valid conditions, demonstrating that subjects can anticipate misclassifications not only under two-alternative forced-choice conditions (as in Experiments 1\u20134), but also when the images appear one at a time in a continuous stream\u2014a skill that may be of value to human\u2013machine teams.
