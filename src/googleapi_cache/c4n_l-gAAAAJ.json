A recent study revealed a series of 3\u20134 topographical maps arranged along the macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex. The maps articulated a two-dimensional space based on the spikiness and animacy of visual objects, with \u201cinanimate-spiky\u201d and \u201cinanimate-stubby\u201d regions of the maps constituting two previously unidentified cortical networks. The goal of our study was to determine whether a similar functional organization might exist in human IT. To address this question, we presented the same object stimuli and images from \u201cclassic\u201d object categories (bodies, faces, houses) to humans while recording fMRI activity at 7 Tesla. Contrasts designed to reveal the spikiness-animacy object space evoked extensive significant activation across human IT. However, unlike the macaque, we did \u2026"

By contrast, state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models of primate vision perform poorly at classifying occluded objects (Coggan and Tong, VSS, 2022). A key difference between biological and artificial visual systems is how they learn from visual examples. CNNs are typically trained using supervised methods to classify images by object category based on labelled data. By contrast, humans learn about objects with a broader range of learning objectives and fewer opportunities for supervised feedback. Here, we asked whether a more naturalistic approach to training CNNs might yield more occlusion-robust models that better predict human neural and behavioural responses to occluded objects. To address this question, we trained an array of CORnet-S model \u2026"

While human observers are much better at discriminating small differences in orientation that are near cardinal rather than oblique (ie, the oblique effect), it is unknown whether surround suppression might reveal a similar orientation-tuned anisotropy. To address this question, we conducted an intensive psychophysical study (5280 trials/observer, N= 12) in which participants reported which of two identically oriented circular figures appeared higher in contrast: one was isolated while the other was surrounded by a bandpass-filtered pattern that differed in mean orientation (range, 0-90). Surround suppression at each relative orientation was measured using an adaptive staircase to adjust the contrast of the isolated figure until it matched the perceived contrast of \u2026"
