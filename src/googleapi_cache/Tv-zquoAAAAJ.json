            "abstract": "Left hemisphere damage in adulthood often leads to linguistic deficits, but many cases of early damage leave linguistic processing preserved, and a functional language system can develop in the right hemisphere. To explain this early apparent equipotentiality of the two hemispheres for language, some have proposed that the language system is bilateral during early development and only becomes left-lateralized with age. We examined language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging with two large pediatric cohorts (total n=273 children ages 4-16; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-level left-hemispheric lateralization (in activation volume and response magnitude) was evident by age 4. Thus, although the right hemisphere can take over language function in some cases of early brain damage, and although some features of the language system do show protracted development (magnitude of language response and strength of inter-regional correlations in the language network), the left-hemisphere bias for language is robustly present by 4 years of age. These results call for alternative accounts of early equipotentiality of the two hemispheres for language.Language is the most canonical function that shows a strong hemispheric asymmetry in adult brains. However, whether the language system is already lateralized to the left hemisphere early in development has long been debated, given that early left-hemisphere damage often leaves language processing unimpaired. We examined the developmental trajectory of language lateralization in two large-scale pediatric datasets using robust individual \u2026"

In online behavioral experiments presenting human observers (N= 1159 English-speaking adults in the United States) with naturalistic vignettes, we find that knowing about the structure (equal or hierarchical) of an existing social relationship markedly reshapes people's expectations for sequences of generous acts. Notably, people do not always expect reciprocal generosity. In hierarchical relationships, people expect the opposite\u2014that the same person will repeat the generous act, following a precedent. These expectations are governed by abstract rules, tailored to specific cultural scripts, affect how people feel about generous acts, and can be used to communicate the desired structure of relationships."

The Rational Action, Noisy Choice for Habituation (RANCH) model formulates looking behaviors as a rational information acquisition process. RANCH instantiates a hypothesis about the perceptual encoding process using a neural network-derived embedding space, which allows it to operate on raw images. In this paper, we show that the model not only captures key looking time patterns such as habituation and dishabituation, but also makes fine-grained, out-of-sample predictions about magnitudes of dishabituation to previously unseen stimuli. We validated those predictions experimentally with a self-paced looking time task in adults (N= 468). We also show that model fits are robust across parameters, but that assumptions about the perceptual encoding process, the learning process and the decision process are all critical for predicting human performance."

In order to study these regions and characterize their representations, we need to first find them. While these functionally-specific cortical regions generally co-localize across people, their precise location varies from one individual to the next. It is therefore necessary to functionally identify each region in each participant individually with a functional localizer scan. However there are many such regions, and running a large number of localizer scans to identify each of them is expensive and time consuming. Here we test the effectiveness of a new experimental design to functionally localize multiple regions of interest robustly, efficiently, and accurately in each participant individually in just 23 minutes of fMRI scan time per person. This new localizer\u2013which presents simultaneous auditory and visual stimuli\u2013is designed to identify, within individual participants, cortical regions selectively engaged in visually processing faces, scenes, bodies, words, and objects, as well as speech sounds, language, and theory of mind. Here we test the success of this new localizer against the current gold standard of established standard localizers for these functions."

By showing each infants several familiarization-test blocks, and varying the way in which the test differs from the familiarization (by varying number of items, pose, animacy and identity), we ask whether different types of violations elicit different degrees of dishabituation relative to a background test trials, in which the same familiar stimulus is shown again.

However, previous work has not looked at whether children can use their understanding of others' mental states to try to change their behaviors. There is an asymmetry between the interventions needed to induce someone to take a new action and the interventions to stop someone from taking a planned action. To induce someone to act, you must ensure that they have both the relevant beliefs and desires; to prevent someone from acting, it is sufficient to remove either the relevant beliefs or desires. In previous work, we saw that adult participants tended to intervene on both beliefs and desires to cause an agent to take an action but only intervened on either the agent's belief or desire to prevent the agent from taking a planned action. We used the same experimental stimuli used in the adult study to see if there is an asymmetry between generative and preventative interventions when young children at the ages of 5-7 design interventions to change others' actions. We didn't see the expected asymmetry of interventions in 5-7-year-old children. Then, we used the same experimental stimuli to test if there is an asymmetry between generative and preventative interventions when older children at the ages of 8-10 design interventions to change others' actions. The results show that older children are able to distinguish generative and preventative outcomes and selectively intervene on both beliefs and desires to cause agents to act but intervene either on beliefs or desires to prevent an action.

By representing mental contents like beliefs, desires, and emotions, Bayesian theory of mind mod- els have made progress in capturing how humans manage these cognitive feats. But social life is not merely observation: hu- mans must also plan to intervene on these same mental con- tents. The present work models how people choose interven- tions to influence others\u2019 emotions. Building on a prior model of people\u2019s intuitive theory of emotions, we model how people use their intuitive theory to evaluate and simulate the effects of different interventions. We apply our model to data from behavioral experiments requiring counterfactual and joint in- terventions, and show a close alignment with human choices. Our results provide a step towards a potentially unifying expla- nation for emotion prediction and intervention, suggesting that they could arise from the same underlying generative model."

Here, we use these asymmetric causal interventions to probe the structure of Theory of Mind. In Experiments 1 and 2, both adults (N=80) and older children (N=42, 8-10 years) distinguished generative and preventative cases: selecting interventions on both mental states (both belief and desire) to induce an agent to act and just one of the mental states (either belief or desire) to prevent an action. However, younger children (N =42, 5-7 years) did not. To probe this age difference, in Experiment 3, we asked younger children(N=42, 5-7 years) just to predict the outcome of others\u2019 mental state interventions. Children predicted that interventions were more likely to prevent actions than to cause them, but failed to predict that intervening on both the relevant beliefs and desires is more likely to generate a novel action than intervening on either alone. These findings suggest that by eight to ten years old, people represent the causal structure of Theory of Mind and can selectively intervene on beliefs and desires to induce and prevent others\u2019 actions."

The Rational Action, Noisy Choice for Habituation (RANCH) model formulates looking behaviors as a rational information acquisition process. RANCH instantiates a hypothesis about the perceptual encoding process using a neural network-derived embedding space, which allows it to operate on raw images. In this paper, we show that the model not only captures key looking time patterns such as habituation and dishabituation, but also makes fine-grained, out-of-sample predictions about magnitudes of dishabituation to previously unseen stimuli. We validated those predictions experimentally with a self-paced looking time task in adults (N = 468). We also show that model fits are robust across parameters, but that assumptions about the perceptual encoding process, the learning process and the decision process are all critical for predicting human performance."

When deciding whether to bluff in a game of poker, we consider the chances that the other players will fold or continue to play and unmask our bluff. When deciding whether to tell our boss that their plans are likely to have adverse effects, we consider a range of reac- tions, from being grateful for our honesty to being dismissed out of spite. Such predictions are highly uncertain and com- plex, not least because the other\u2019s (re)actions usually result from them making equally complex and uncertain inferences about us. Nevertheless, we are often remarkably successful \u2013 although sometimes utterly wrong \u2013 in our social inferences. How do we explain these successes and failures?"

Here we test the explanation that sequences of generosity regulate social relationships. We find that people selectively expect reciprocal generosity in equal (vs. hierarchical) relationships, use reciprocal generosity to infer the presence of an equal relationship, and critically expect that people reciprocate generosity in order to communicate a desire for a (more) equal relationship. In a formal planning model, reciprocal generosity can emerge from the value of communicating desired equality."

            "abstract": "Humans effortlessly use vision to plan and guide navigation through the local environment, or \"scene\". A network of three cortical regions responds selectively to visual scene information, including the occipital (OPA), parahippocampal (PPA), and medial place areas (MPA) - but how this network supports visually-guided navigation is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that one region in particular, the OPA, supports visual representations for navigation, while PPA and MPA support other aspects of scene processing. However, most previous studies tested only static scene images, which lack the dynamic experience of navigating through scenes. We used dynamic movie stimuli to test whether OPA, PPA, and MPA represent two critical kinds of navigationally-relevant information: navigational affordances (e.g., can I walk to the left, right, or both?) and ego-motion (e.g., am I walking forward or backward? turning left or right?). We found that OPA is sensitive to both affordances and ego-motion, as well as the conflict between these cues - e.g., turning toward versus away from an open doorway. These effects were significantly weaker or absent in PPA and MPA. Responses in OPA were also dissociable from those in early visual cortex, consistent with the idea that OPA responses are not merely explained by lower-level visual features. OPA responses to affordances and ego-motion were stronger in the contralateral than ipsilateral visual field, suggesting that OPA encodes navigationally relevant information within an egocentric reference frame. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that OPA contains visual representations that are useful \u2026"
