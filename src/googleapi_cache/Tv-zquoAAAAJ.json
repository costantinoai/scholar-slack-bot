Here, we describe an open dataset of responses from children who completed a story booklet task for assessing ToM reasoning (n=321 3\u201312-year-old children, including 64 (neurotypical) children assessed longitudinally and 68 autistic children). Children completed one of two versions of the story booklet task (Booklet 1 or 2). Both versions include two-alternative forced choice and free response questions that tap ToM concepts ranging in difficulty from reasoning about desires and beliefs to reasoning about moral blameworthiness and mistaken referents. Booklet 2 additionally includes items that assess understanding of sarcasm, lies, and second-order belief-desire reasoning. Compared to other ToM tasks, the booklet task provides relatively dense sampling of ToM reasoning \u2026"

We evaluated the model with adult looking time collected from a paradigm analogous to the infant habituation paradigm. We compared RANCH with baseline models (no learning model, no perceptual noise model) and models with alternative linking hypotheses (Surprisal, KL divergence).

Recent theory suggests that people should be more willing to steal if they are on the wrong side of a \u2018desperation threshold\u2019; that is, a level of resources critical to wellbeing. Below such a threshold, people should pursue any risky behaviour that offers the possibility of a short route back above, and should be insensitive to the severity of possible punishments, since they have little left to lose. We developed a multi-round, multi-player economic game with a desperation threshold and the possibility of theft as well as cooperation. Across four experiments with 1000 UK and US adults, we showed that falling short of a desperation threshold increased stealing from other players, even when the payoff from stealing \u2026"

This article tests the hypothesis that integrated representations of identity and expression arise spontaneously within deep neural networks. A subset of the CelebA dataset is used to train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to label face identity (chance = 0.06%, accuracy = 26.5%), and the FER2013 dataset is used to train a DCNN to label facial expression (chance = 14.2%, accuracy = 63.5%). The identity-trained and expression-trained networks each successfully transfer to labeling both face identity and facial expression on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces dataset. This study demonstrates that DCNNs trained to recognize face identity and DCNNs trained to recognize facial expression spontaneously develop representations of facial expression and face identity, respectively. Furthermore, a congruence coefficient analysis reveals that features distinguishing between identities and features distinguishing between expressions become increasingly orthogonal from layer to layer, suggesting that deep neural networks disentangle representational subspaces corresponding to different sources."

To determine whether canonical left-hemisphere language regions are sensitive to features of dialogue beyond the comprehensibility of the speech stream, we scanned 20 adults on two novel tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In the first, participants watched videos of puppets speaking either to the viewer (monologue) or to a partner (dialogue), while the audio was either comprehensible (forward) or reversed (backward). Canonical left-hemisphere language regions responded more to forward than backward speech, as expected, but did not respond more to dialogue than monologue. In a second task, two puppets conversed with each other, but only one was comprehensible while the other's speech stream was reversed. Left-hemisphere cortical language regions again responded more to forward than backwards speech, and activity in these regions was only correlated among participants who heard the same characters speaking forward and backward. In contrast, some theory of mind regions and right hemisphere homologues of language regions responded more to dialogue than monologue, and activity in some of these regions was correlated among participants even when opposite characters were speaking forward and backward (in both cases, the visual video clips were held constant).

Visually observed actions, eye gaze, and facial expressions of others provide information about mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and emotions. Does such experience contribute causally to the development of cortical networks supporting social cognition? To address this question we compared functional development of brain regions supporting theory of mind (ToM), as well as behavioral ToM reasoning, across congenitally blind (n=17) and sighted (n=114) children and adolescents (4\u201317 years old). We find that blind children in this age range show slightly lower ToM behavioral performance relative to sighted children. Likewise, the functional profile of ToM brain regions is qualitatively similar, but quantitatively weaker in blind relative to sighted children. Alongside prior research, these \u2026"

If actions are jointly caused by appropriate pairs of desires and beliefs, there exists an asymmetry between the interventions to induce someone to take a new action and the interventions to stop someone from taking a planned action. To induce someone to act, you have to ensure that they have both the relevant beliefs and desires; to prevent someone from acting, it is sufficient to remove either the relevant beliefs or desires. In a previous study, we tested for this asymmetry between generative and preventative interventions using vignettes of real-life situations that describe characters' mental states and plans to act or not to act. For each vignette, we gave participants three action options: choice A is intended to change what the other character believes; choice B is intended to change what the other character desires/wants, and choice C is to perform both A and B. We found that people's choices of action varied significantly based on if the interventions are generative, where the goal is to make the character act when they had not previously intended to, or preventative, where the goal is to prevent the character from taking the action they had initially intended. More specifically, adult participants chose the options that act on others' both desires and beliefs more often in the generative than the preventative condition. In the current study, we use a rank of preference paradigm to test whether adults make this distinction in intervening on others' beliefs and desires to generate versus prevent their actions.

This has led to debate about whether shared or distinct mechanisms lead infants to look longer toward unexpected events (the violation-of-expectation response, or VOE) versus visually novel events (the perceptual novelty response, or PN). Here, we studied both looking behaviors using meta-analysis of condition-level data (from 34 papers, 78 conditions, and 1915 infants) and mega-analysis of infant-level data (from 25 papers, 60 conditions, and 1482 infants) from prior studies of infants\u2019 understanding of agents and objects. First, we estimated VOE and PN in the same data and found that showing infants an unexpected event drove their looking behavior as reliably as showing infants a visually novel event. Second, we tested whether VOE and PN are supported by similar or distinct mechanisms. Under the hypothesis that both responses are driven by a common mechanism, the same factors should predict the size of both effects. However, these responses were moderated by different predictors. The PN effect was larger after infants were habituated instead of familiarized, and did not differ depending on infant age. The VOE effect, in contrast, was not moderated by habituation vs familiarization and was larger for younger infants. These findings suggest that these two responses reflect distinct drivers of infant visual attention"

Here we developed a measure of navigational affordance perception based only on preferential looking. Infants and toddlers viewed 10s videos depicting an egocentric perspective of navigation toward the corner of a room, with one wall containing an open doorway affording further navigation, and the other containing a perceptually similar distractor.

Yet choosing to punish also reveals information about the authority\u2019s own motives and values. We propose that observers jointly infer the wrongness of the action and the authority\u2019s motivations. Using hypothetical scenarios in unfamiliar societies, we experimentally manipulated observers\u2019 prior beliefs and measured human observers\u2019 inferences after observing punishment. These inferences were recapitulated in a formal model that inverts an intuitive causal model of authorities who make rational choices about punishment by weighing its costs and benefits (ie utilities). An essential component of this model, driving these inferences, is that legitimate authorities consider the utility of a proportional response to harmful actions, which depends on the balance between the wrongness of the act and the severity of the punishment."

When these interactions recur, people can form expectations to balance who is better off over time. What does it mean when asymmetric social interactions recur, and what can we learn from how people solve these dilemmas? We hypothesize that people expect social interactions to recur when two people are in a social relationship, and that knowing about the symmetry of the social relationship influences the stable solution to asymmetric coordination dilemmas over time. We report two experiments where participants read stories and answered questions about social interactions between two people. In Experiment 1, participants infer that two people are in a social relationship when there is a sequence of altruistic interactions between them, and specifically infer an asymmetric relationship when one person always performs the altruistic action, and a symmetric relationship when the two people alternate performing the altruistic action. In Experiment 2, participants equally expect alternating and repeating altruistic actions when the relationship is symmetric, but expect repeating actions (following a precedent) when the relationship is asymmetric. Our results suggest that people are able to use knowledge of relationships to generate shared expectations for coordinating on recurrent altruistic social interactions, and vice versa."

In a pre-registered experiment, we scanned 32 adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they watched videos of agents and objects, adapted from infant behavioral research. Early visual regions responded equally to surprising and expected events in both domains, providing evidence against domain-general visual prediction error. Some multiple demand regions, that are engaged when people deploy goal-directed attention, responded more to surprising events from both domains, providing evidence for domain-general endogenous attention. Domain-specific regions, that prefer stimuli involving agents vs objects more broadly, showed similar preferences for the current videos of agents and objects. One region implicated in physical reasoning responded selectively to unexpected events from the physical domain, providing evidence for domain-specific physical prediction error. Thus, in adult brains, both domain-specific and high-level domain-general regions encode violation-of-expectation involving agents and objects, paving the way towards future developmental work."
