Because letter-sound coupling is crucial in reading, we investigated the engagement of the lvOT cortex in processing phonology (ie, the sound patterns of words) as a function of reading acquisition. We tested 47 Polish children both at the beginning of formal literacy instruction and 2 years later. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, children performed auditory phonological tasks from small to large grain size levels (ie, single phoneme, rhyme). We showed that orthographically relevant lvOT areas activated during small-grain size phonological tasks were skill-dependent, perhaps due to the relatively transparent mappings between orthography and phonology in Polish. We also studied activation pattern similarity between processing visual and auditory word \u2026"

Neuroimaging data showed that voxels weakly specialized for visual processing keep their initial category selectivity (i.e., object or face processing) while acquiring an additional and stronger responsivity to written words. Here, we examined a large and diverse group of six-year-olds prior to formal literacy training (N = 72) using various data analysis techniques (univariate, multivariate, rapid adaptation) and types of stimuli (print, false fonts, houses, faces) to further explore how VOT changes and adapts to the novel skill of reading. We found that among several visual stimuli categories only print activated a wide network of language related areas outside of the bilateral visual cortex, and the level of reading skill was related to the strength of this \u2026"

We compared Braille to print reading in 53 blind and 53 sighted Polish-speaking subjects (age: 9-60). Blind subjects were more proficient in PA tasks than sighted subjects. Additionally, the relationship between PA and reading was different between the groups and interacted with age. In the blind, PA explained a significant proportion of variance in reading efficiency in school-aged Braille readers only. RAN turned out to explain a significant amount of reading skills variance, independently of the modality. Tactile reading seems to alter cognitive correlates of reading. It may also influence the pace at which reading is acquired"

However, in the past 20 years, empirical studies have challenged the assumptions of this brain region as processing exclusively visual or even orthographic stimuli. In this review, we aimed to present the development of understanding of the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex from the visually based letter area to the modality-independent symbolic language related region. We discuss theoretical and empirical research that includes orthographic, phonological, and semantic properties of language. Existing results showed that involvement of the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex is not limited to unimodal activity \u2026"

Here, we investigated the similarities and differences between LS integration in blind Braille (N = 42, age range: 9\u201360 y.o.) and sighted print (N = 47, age range: 9\u201360 y.o.) readers who acquired reading using different sensory modalities. In both groups, the STC responded to both isolated letters and isolated speech sounds, showed enhanced activation when they were presented together, and distinguished between congruent and incongruent letter and speech sound pairs. However, the direction of the congruency effect was \u2026"

Other theories argue that numerical symbols represent a separate number category that emerges only during education. Here, we tested a unique group of sighted tactile Braille readers with numerosities 2, 4, 6 and 8 in three number notations: Arabic digits, sets of dots, tactile Braille numbers. Using univariate methods, we showed a consistent overlap in activations evoked by these three number notations. This result shows that \u2026"
