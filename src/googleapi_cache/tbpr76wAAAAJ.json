            "abstract": "Recent reviews emphasized the need for investigating the complexity of multiple subareas of word selectivity and how this relates to selectivity for other visual categories, at the individual level at a high spatial resolution (without normalization or smoothing). To investigate this, both on the brain surface and in the representational space of the occipitotemporal cortex, we presented 19 participants with images of 20 different categories during 7T fMRI. These categories included several word-like conditions, and in addition cover many of the dimensions that have been suggested to define object space, such as animacy and real-world size. In the left hemisphere, we found three subareas of the visual word form area (VWFA) and one extra subarea around the pFus face-selective area. We also observed several areas of selectivity to hands that could consistently guide the localization of word and face areas. No clear \u2026"

However, the tuning properties of human ventral stream neurons for object shape and category are virtually unknown. We performed large-scale recordings of spiking activity in human Lateral Occipital Complex in response to stimuli in which the shape dimension was dissociated from the category dimension. Consistent with studies in nonhuman primates, the neuronal representations were primarily shape-based, although we also observed category-like encoding for images of animals. Surprisingly, linear decoders could reliably classify stimulus category even in data sets that were entirely shape-based. In addition, many recording sites showed an interaction between shape and category tuning. These results represent a detailed study on shape and category \u2026"

Here we investigate the effect of expertise in reading visual Braille, a script developed for touch that does not share the typical explicit shape information of other alphabets. We compared visual Braille readers and a naive control group and found that individually localized visual word form area  VWFA) was selectively activated for visual Braille when compared to scrambled Braille, but only in expert Braille readers. Multivariate analyses showed that linguistic properties can be decoded from Latin in both groups and from Braille in expert readers. Yet, cross-script generalization failed to reveal common representations across Latin and Braille scripts in experts, suggesting script-specific orthographic representations. Primary visual cortex, shape-selective areas (LO), and linguistic areas (l-PosTemp) showed similar multivariate profiles to VWFA, but with cross-script generalization in left Posterior Temporal area only. We conclude that the linguistic properties of a visual script, rather than low-level line-junctions properties, play a major role in how the visual system, and VWFA in particular, processes scripts."
