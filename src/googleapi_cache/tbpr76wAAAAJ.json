Some of their proposals still stand, yet the simplicity is gone. Recent evolutions in behavioral paradigms, neuroscientific methods, and computational modeling have allowed vision scientists to uncover the complexity of the multidimensional representational space that underlies object vision. We review these findings and propose that the key to understanding this complexity is to relate object vision to the full repertoire of behavioral goals that underlie human behavior, running far beyond object recognition. There might be no such thing as core object recognition, and if it exists, then its importance is more limited than traditionally thought."

Given prior suggestions that, generally, rodents might rely upon contrast features for object recognition, we hypothesized that they would pick up the typical contrast features relevant for face detection.

A corollary of this process is that whatever weaknesses and biases the original model possesses, the derived model will also have. Some of these have already been extensively covered, but color sensitivity has so far been understudied. This paper explores the prediction stability of several popular CNN architectures when input images are subjected to hue or saturation shifts. We show that even small shifts in image hue can alter a model\u2019s initial prediction, with larger shifts introducing changes up to 60% and 40% of the time for AlexNet and VGG16 respectively.

            "abstract": "The visual system comprises two distinct hierarchically organized pathways: the dorsal and the ventral stream. As we move up along the hierarchy in the ventral stream, the size of neurons' receptive fields increases and the features to which neurons respond become more complex. Finally, neural responses in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal cortex contain elaborate representations of the identity of visual stimuli, thus playing an invaluable role in object recognition. Accurate object recognition is both selective and tolerant. On the one hand, object representations should be selective enough to ensure that objects with a highly similar appearance can be distinguished from one another. On the other hand, object representations should also be sufficiently tolerant to changes in appearance that are caused by different viewing conditions. In this doctoral project, we aimed to improve our understanding of how object representations that are tolerant to transformations emerge in the brain, and more specifically what role temporal contiguity training plays in this process. In a second part of the project, we took a step back from our primary focus on high-level vision, and instead broadened our scope of attention to the entire ventral visual stream. Concretely, we investigated how symmetry perception is related to visual representations and neural communication between specific brain regions across the ventral visual pathway. The first study (Chapter 2) investigated whether viewpoint tolerance is reflected in the neural visual system and whether it can be manipulated through training (Van Meel & Op de Beeck, 2018).

However, the tuning properties of human ventral stream neurons for object shape and category are virtually unknown. We performed the first large-scale recordings of spiking activity in human Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC) in response to stimuli in which the shape dimension was manipulated independently from the category dimension. The neuronal representations in LOC were primarily shape-based, although we also observed category-like encoding for images of animals. Surprisingly, linear decoders could reliably classify stimulus category even in data sets that were entirely shape-based. In addition, many tuning curves showed an interaction between shape and category tuning. These results represent the first detailed study on shape and category coding at the neuronal level in the human ventral visual stream, furnishing essential evidence that reconciles human imaging and macaque single-cell studies."

Decoding object identity in this hierarchy is partially a bottom-up process, which accounts well for the recognition of easy, canonical appearances. Most natural settings, however, are visually complex, and present challenging viewing conditions. In the presence of visual uncertainty, the recognition of object identity is hence a hard decoding problem that cannot be solved by a purely bottom-up process. The human brain, however, is highly non-feedforward, and each area sends its connections downward or horizontally in the hierarchy. This non bottom-up, recurrent connectivity is thought to provide the necessary computational power to solve object recognition in the face of visual complexity. While evidence for this role is accumulating, the exact mechanisms of recurrent processing remain \u2026"

            "abstract": "I spy with my little eye, a well-loved childhood game that many people like to play. As scientists, we were wondering how the brain solves such a task, where certain objects have to be found in a scene, or known objects have to be recognized from different viewpoints. This is exactly what the domain of invariant object recognition focuses on. To understand how the human vision system performs this task, we have to take a closer look at the neural underpinnings of the human brain. From previous studies, we know that the brain processes visual information through two functionally and anatomically distinct pathways. The pathway we focused on in this dissertation is the ventral visual pathway, or the what stream, as it focuses on object identity and recognition. Visual information consists of two different kinds of features: low-level features and high-level features and these features are processed differently in the human brain. In this dissertation, we wanted to investigate this ventral visual stream by using two models with which we can or try to model high-level visual processing. The first model is the rat model, and we have used this animal model throughout all three studies. In our first two studies, the animals were trained in a face categorization task, using stimuli of human faces as targets and random objects (Chapter 2) or noisy stimuli (Chapter 3) as distractors. We found that rats were capable of learning these complex categorization tasks and that they were able to generalize to new, unseen stimuli, even after applying transformations to these stimuli. In our second study, we focused on contrast features, a low-level feature that has been \u2026"

            "abstract": "Human vision is still largely unexplained. Computer vision made impressive progress on this front, but it is still unclear to which extent artificial neural networks approximate human object vision at the behavioral and neural levels. Here, we investigated whether machine object vision mimics the representational hierarchy of human object vision with an experimental design that allows testing within-domain representations for animals and scenes, as well as across-domain representations reflecting their real-world contextual regularities such as animal-scene pairs that often co-occur in the visual environment. We found that DCNNs trained in object recognition acquire representations, in their late processing stage, that closely capture human conceptual judgements about the co-occurrence of animals and their typical scenes. Likewise, the DCNNs representational hierarchy shows surprising similarities with the representational transformations emerging in domain-specific ventrotemporal areas up to domain-general frontoparietal areas. Despite these remarkable similarities, the underlying information processing differs. The ability of neural networks to learn a human-like high-level conceptual representation of object-scene co-occurrence depends upon the amount of object-scene co-occurrence present in the image set thus highlighting the fundamental role of training history. Further, although mid/high-level DCNN layers represent the category division for animals and scenes as observed in VTC, its information content shows reduced domain-specific representational richness. To conclude, by testing within- and between-domain selectivity while \u2026"

            "abstract": "Visual Perceptual Learning takes up a great deal of our lives, where for some of us, it leads to becoming an expert (eg, radiology). The tradition of training specific outcomes is challenged by generalization to other features, retinal locations or other general domains (eg, multi-tasking). Yet, the mechanisms underlying transfer lead to inconsistent findings, such as whether playing video games results in transfer. The first study aimed to integrate as many factors known to contribute to transfer, which resulted in a gamified perceptual learning paradigm. A simple game was given to the control group, whilst the experimental group was trained with the paradigm for 10 hours. We observed effects of transfer to other objects, locations, and domains (eg, executive functioning), which were stronger in the experimental group for object transfer. These positive effects led to an investigation of the neural underpinnings of these findings in a second fMRI study. Before and after a 15 hour training on the same paradigm/game, subjects participated in a fMRI session. Results showed enhanced neural sensitivity for low-level stimuli in the brain's object region with training. An unfortunate lack of signal in the scanning paradigm caused problems picking up expected and more subtle sensitivity differences. The surge of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in VPL resulted in two more studies with a computational approach on visual object expertise. Study three aimed to investigate intra-class specificity in different instances of a CNN and correlate these representations with the behavioral and neural representations in novices and experts.

Recent research suggested to combine computational and animal modelling in order to obtain a more systematic understanding of task complexity and compare strategies between species. In the present study, we created a large multidimensional stimulus set and designed a visual discrimination task partially based upon modelling with a convolutional deep neural network (CNN). Experiments included rats (N = 11; 1115 daily sessions in total for all rats together) and humans (N = 45). Each species was able to master the task and generalize to a variety of new images. Nevertheless, rats and humans showed very little convergence in terms of which object pairs were associated with high and low performance, suggesting the use of different strategies. There was an interaction between species and whether stimulus pairs favoured early or late processing in a CNN. A direct comparison with CNN representations and visual feature analyses revealed that rat performance was best captured by late convolutional layers and partially by visual features such as brightness and pixel-level similarity, while human performance related more to the higher-up fully connected layers. These findings highlight the additional value of using a computational approach for the design of object recognition tasks. Overall, this computationally informed investigation of object recognition behaviour reveals a strong discrepancy in strategies between rodent and human vision."

However, the tuning properties of human ventral stream neurons for object shape and category are virtually unknown. We performed the first large-scale recordings of spiking activity in human Lateral Occipital Complex in response to stimuli in which the shape dimension was dissociated from the category dimension. Consistent with studies in nonhuman primates, the neuronal representations were primarily shape-based, although we also observed category-like encoding for images of animals. Surprisingly, linear decoders could reliably classify stimulus category even in data sets that were entirely shape-based. In addition, many tuning curves showed an interaction between shape and category tuning. These results represent the first detailed study on shape and category coding at the neuronal level in the human ventral visual stream, furnishing essential evidence that reconciles human imaging and macaque single-cell studies."

The initially activated representations to lookalike zoomorphic objects are very similar to the representations activated by animal pictures and very different from the neural responses to regular objects. Neural responses that reflect the true identity of the zoomorphic objects as inanimate objects are weaker and appear later, as do effects of task context.
