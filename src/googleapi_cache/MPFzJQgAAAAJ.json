            "abstract": "According to theories of visual search, observers generate a visual representation of the search target (the \u201cattentional template\u201d) that guides spatial attention toward target-like visual input. In real-world vision, however, objects produce vastly different visual input depending on their location: your car produces a retinal image that is 10 times smaller when it is parked 50 compared to 5 m away. Across four experiments, we investigated whether the attentional template incorporates viewing distance when observers search for familiar object categories. On each trial, participants were precued to search for a car or person in the near or far plane of an outdoor scene. In \u201csearch trials,\u201d the scene reappeared and participants had to indicate whether the search target was present or absent. In intermixed \u201ccatch-trials,\u201d two silhouettes were briefly presented on either side of fixation (matching the shape and/or predicted size of \u2026"

            "abstract": "Capacity limitations in visual tasks can be observed when the number of task-related objects increases. An influential idea is that such capacity limitations are determined by competition at the neural level: two objects that are encoded by shared neural populations interfere more in behavior (e.g., visual search) than two objects encoded by separate neural populations. However, the neural representational similarity of objects varies across brain regions and across time, raising the questions of where and when competition determines task performance. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between neural representational similarity and task performance is common or unique across tasks. Here, we used neural representational similarity derived from fMRI, MEG, and a deep neural network (DNN) to predict performance on two visual search tasks involving the same objects and requiring the same \u2026"

However, it remains unclear under which circumstances an attention schema is computationally useful, and whether it can emerge in a learning system without hard-wiring it. To address these questions, we trained a reinforcement learning agent with attention to track and catch a ball in a noisy environment. Crucially, the agent had additional neural resources that it could freely use. We asked under which conditions these additional resources develop an attention schema to track attention. We found that the more uncertain the agent was about the location of its attentional state, the more it benefited from these additional resources, which developed an attention schema. Together, these results indicate that an attention schema emerges in simple learning systems where attention is both important and difficult to track."
