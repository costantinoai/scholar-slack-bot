However, the effect of deep gray matter atrophy on IPS deficits is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of deep gray matter volume changes on IPS in people with early relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) compared to healthy control.In this case-control study, we enrolled 63 case with RRMS and 36 healthy controls. All patients were diagnosed within 6 years. IPS was evaluated using the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA) test. We also performed a 1.5T MRI to evaluate deep gray matter structures.People with RRMS had lower accuracy in the ICA test (p = .01 \u2026"

Few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated high-level visual deficits in AD, yet none have explored brain activity patterns during rapid animal/non-animal categorization tasks. Objective To address this, we utilized the previously known Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA) to collect fMRI data and compare healthy controls (HC) to individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD. Methods The ICA encompasses a rapid visual categorization task that involves distinguishing between animals and nonanimals within natural scenes. To comprehensively explore variations in brain activity levels and patterns, we conducted both univariate and multivariate analyses of fMRI data."

The model combined a decision tree to capture the initial outcomes of the cognitive testing with a Markov structure that estimated long-term outcomes of people with dementia. Quality of life outcomes were quantified using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the economic benefits were assessed using net monetary benefit (NMB). Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5% per annum and cost-effectiveness was assessed using a threshold of\u00a3 20,000 per \u2026"
