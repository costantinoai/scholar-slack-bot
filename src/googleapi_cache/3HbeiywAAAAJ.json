Techniques are described for receiving response data comprising a plurality of inputs by a subject and at least one input characteristic associated with the plurality of inputs, receiving characteristic data comprising a parameter indicative of a characteristic associated with the subject, processing the response data and the characteristic data, comparing the processed response data to reference response data or to model reference data, comparing the processed characteristic data to corresponding reference characteristic data or to model characteristic data, and determining a status of at least one biomarker of a brain disorder in the brain of the subject based on the comparisons."
