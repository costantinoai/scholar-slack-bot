            "abstract": "Humans can visually recognize many actions performed by others, as well as communicate about them. How are action concepts organized in the mind? Recent work has uncovered shared neural representations of actions across vision and language, yet the semantic structure of these representations is not well understood. To address this, we curated a multimodal, naturalistic action set containing 95 videos of everyday actions from the Moments in Time dataset (Monfort et al., 2019) and 95 naturalistic sentences describing the same actions. We labeled each action with four semantic features: a specific action verb (eg, chopping); an everyday activity (representing a set of actions; eg, preparing food); the target of the action (eg, an object); and a broad action class (eg, manipulation; Orban et al., 2021). We also annotated the actions with other relevant social and action-related features. We used these features to \u2026"

Alterations in neural integration and cortical connectivity have been linked to the spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders seen in 22q11.2DS and may be a mechanism by which the CNV acts to increase risk. In this study, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to investigate electrophysiological markers of local and global network function in 34 children with 22q11.2DS and 25 controls aged 10\u201317 years old.

What organizing dimensions does the mind use to make sense of this complex action space? To address this question, we collected intuitive similarity judgments across two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos depicting everyday actions. We used cross-validated sparse non-negative matrix factorization to identify the structure underlying action similarity judgments. A low-dimensional representation, consisting of nine to ten dimensions, was sufficient to accurately reconstruct human similarity judgments. The dimensions were robust to stimulus set perturbations and reproducible in a separate odd-one-out experiment. Human labels mapped these dimensions onto semantic axes relating to food, work, and home life; social axes relating to people and emotions; and one \u2026"
