            "abstract": "Neurons in primary visual cortex are driven by feedforward visual inputs and top-down contextual inputs. The nature of this contextual information is difficult to study, as responses to feedforward and top-down inputs overlap in time and are difficult to disentangle experimentally. To address this issue, we measured responses to natural images and partially occluded versions of these images in the visual cortex of mice. Assessing neuronal responses before and after familiarizing mice with the non-occluded images allowed us to study experience-dependent and stimulus-specific contextual responses in pyramidal cells (PyCs) in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 in the absence of feedforward input. Surprisingly, in the same retinotopic region of cortex, we found that separate populations of PyCs in layer 2/3 responded to occluded and non-occluded images. Responses of PyCs selective for occluded images were strengthened upon familiarization and decoding analysis revealed they contained image-specific information, suggesting that they signaled the absence of predicted visual stimuli. Responses of PyCs selective for non-occluded scenes were weaker for familiarized images but stronger for unfamiliar images, suggesting that these neurons signaled the presence of unpredicted visual stimuli. Layer 5 also contained PyCs preferring either feedforward or contextual inputs, but their responses were more complex and strengthening of responses to occluded images required task engagement. The results show that visual experience decreases the activity of neurons responding to known feedforward inputs but increases the activity of neurons responding to \u2026"

Here, we characterise object and scene-related feedback information to V1. Participants identified foreground objects or background scenes in images with occluded central and peripheral subsections, allowing us to isolate feedback activity to foveal and peripheral regions of V1. Using fMRI and multivoxel pattern classification, we found that feedback of object information is projected to foveal V1 cortex with increased detail during an object identification task.

We find that imagery content is decodable mainly from deep layers of V1, whereas seemingly \u2018real\u2019 illusory content is decodable mainly from superficial layers. Furthermore, illusory content shares information with perceptual content, whilst imagery content does not generalise to illusory or perceptual information.

While traditional atlas-based methods can be applied to volumes from any acquisition site, recent deep learning algorithms ensure high accuracy only when tested on data from the same sites exploited in training (i.e., internal data). Performance degradation experienced on external data (i.e., unseen volumes from unseen sites) is due to the inter-site variability in intensity distributions, and to unique artifacts caused by different MR scanner models and acquisition parameters. To mitigate this site-dependency, often referred to as the scanner effect, we propose LOD-Brain, a 3D convolutional neural network with progressive levels-of-detail (LOD), able to segment brain data from any site.

Using multivariate pattern analysis, we showed that both contextual and time-distant information, coexist in V1 and V2 as feedback signals. In addition, we found that the extent to which mnemonic information is reinstated in V1 and V2 depends on whether the information is retrieved episodically or semantically. Critically, this reinstatement was independent on the retrieval route in the object-selective cortex.

To address this challenge, we recorded the spiking activity of V1 neurons in monkeys viewing either natural scenes or scenes where the information in the RF was occluded, effectively removing the feedforward input. We found that V1 neurons responded rapidly and selectively to occluded scenes. V1 responses elicited by occluded stimuli could be used to decode individual scenes and could be predicted from those elicited by non-occluded images, indicating that there is an overlap between visually driven and contextual responses.

In the present paper we aim at reducing the gap between research, clinical practice, patients\u2019 and their caregivers\u2019 needs regarding disorders of consciousness. By implementing a multidisciplinary and multidimensional approach, the paper focuses on disorders of consciousness: it starts from the review of some of the most promising measures of consciousness from brain activity (ie, spectral measures, measures of functional connectivity, complexity-based measures). Next the paper introduces brain responses to illusions as a new indicator of consciousness (ie, a feature that facilitates the attribution of consciousness), and illustrates the clinical operationalization of the indicators of consciousness through the case of virtual reality. Finally, the paper analyzes a set of urgent ethical issues and describes a model for assessing and dealing with those issues, concluding by elaborating key recommendations for improving the clinical treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness through a better translation of research into clinics."

In contrast, earlier levels of our visual system respond to small detailed visual features, such as lines oriented in a certain direction and at precise spatial locations. High- and low-level visual areas are reciprocally connected, and visual perception emerges from recurrent neuronal computations between these areas. When tuning our brain imaging analysis to the spatial precision of the top-down connections from higher- to lower-level visual areas, do higher areas project their coarse spatial tuning or is this processing translated to the high-precision coding of the lower-level target region they are projecting to? For example, while neurons in early visual areas respond to the precise location of a cup on your desk, and higher-level areas continue to respond to the cup even when the cup is slightly moved, how is communication between higher-level visual areas and lower-level visual areas resolved? We hypothesised that the more generalised contextual information of \u2018the cup is somewhere here\u2019 is broadcast to cells in lower visual areas that would otherwise not respond, and those that are responding with the information \u2018an object boundary is precisely detected here\u2019 can now confirm whether it is consistent with the explanation that this contour belongs to a cup. In line with this hypothesis, we found that early visual areas receive feedback information that generalises across images in which the features have been spatially displaced. The data inform \u2026"

Line-scanning can enhance spatial resolution to 0.2-0.4 mm while maintaining sub-second TR. It is therefore an ideal method to study temporal evolution of BOLD responses across cortical layers. However, current saturation schemes for human line-scanning suffer from broad saturation profiles that lead to signal contamination of BOLD responses from adjacent areas. We implemented line-scanning in humans with sharp line-profiles of 3 mm. Using this method, we show that cortical layers of M1 have unique BOLD time courses."

            "abstract": "How do we develop models of the world? Contextualising ambiguous information with previous experience allows us to form an enriched perception. Contextual information and prior knowledge facilitate perceptual processing, improving our recognition of even distorted or obstructed visual inputs. As a result, neuronal processing elicited by identical sensory inputs varies depending on the context in which we encounter those inputs. This modulation is in line with predictive processing accounts of vision which suggest that the brain uses internal models of the world to predict sensory inputs, with cortical feedback processing in sensory areas encoding beliefs about those inputs. As such, acquiring knowledge should enhance our internal models that we use to resolve sensory ambiguities, and feedback signals should encode more accurate estimates of sensory inputs. We used partially occluded Mooney images, ambiguous two-tone images which are difficult to recognise without prior knowledge of the image content, in behavioural and 3T fMRI experiments to measure if contextual feedback signals in early visual areas are modulated by learning. We show that perceptual priors add sensory detail to contextual feedback processing in early visual areas in response to subsequent presentations of previously ambiguous images."
